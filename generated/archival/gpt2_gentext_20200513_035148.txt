Inclusion in life means you must always be a willing partner in the dance. You cannot always do it alone, nor can you always do it with others. Only together can they be made.

No man, for any considerable period, can stand in awe of nature. For in each human soul there is a circle of tolerance, a network of friends, a circle of security. Let not men's passions cast doubt upon the divine right of things; let not their blindness occasion a doubt before every act of charity. Let every act of kindness, every thought, every act of courtesy, be appreciated and remembered. For from within we can grow; from without we can grow dim. Love is blind; affection is not so. Friend is visible; esteem is true. Difference is not in nature but in us. Diversity is everywhere; necessity is weak. Exceptionalism is rigid. Superiorism is progressive. Density is not in nature but in society.

The world is like a 10 speed bicycle.  Most of the gears are 15 speed and some of the chain is 3 speed. There is a big difference between riding a 5 speed bicycle and riding a 10 speed bicycle.
