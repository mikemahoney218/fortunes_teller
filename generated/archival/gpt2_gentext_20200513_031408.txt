<|startoftext|>It's been known for a long time that Linux can be used for source control, and that its authors intend no injustice when they deny their users the freedom to change the source code. I am pleased to say that we are finally advancing this point to the extent that comments in the source code can be changed to include a `-b' flag. It's still not too late to do it, of course, but there is a `-c' flag for source code that is somewhat more powerful than the `-b' flag. The documentation for R-devel is better than the Nautilus documentation for R. The documentation for R is much, much better than the Nautilus documentation for R.

Even though it is by no means a corollary to the preceding statement, the latter still holds water. You see, the doctrine of a personal God, at least as we understand it in the West, is a delusion. God is not capricious or arbitrary. God is nothing but a constant and predictable thing, nothing born and raised but one of those things which nature makes and fixes for herself. The thing, then, which is called Providence, is really Divine Mercy, and the principal reason why the world ends in itself, not in spite of it.
