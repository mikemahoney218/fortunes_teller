One of my new passions, and it's the reason I have such a good memory -- is finding things to have done with the old values and ways of the past. It's a totally new way of looking at things.

The new codes of conduct, by and large, are about helping the disadvantaged and the powerless. They are never about forcing the past into the future.

The second, of course, is that the old EPUB file formats, such as 'RText' and 'RText.txt', are not supported by most modern UNIX systems.

In order to understand the world you have to understand yourself. That is, you have to feel, not think, and not believe. The mind, like the heart, knows nothing. It is only the body, the symbol of the soul, can be touched by the touch of the heart.

As is our way of life, so is the potential of humanity. When we are engaged in a meaningful way in transforming the world around us, we find that our actions, not our words, the wisdom of our calling, the strength of our purpose, the transparency of our character, the generousness of our affections, the penetrative fairness of our love...all these are gifts and they are our treasures.

There is something deeply wrong with the human race, and I mean fundamentally, something inherently repulsive and horrible, something which cannot be cured by the pathetic attempts of the few who venture to claim the cure-all of words. In my opinion, the cure for the repulsive force of words is to throw it away and use the force of words. The repulsive force of words is the original and powerful magic ingredient of all other things.

There's a curious phenomenon called convergence in which two seemingly unrelated items (for example, the *number* and *display* symbols) come to *exist* in the same *code* somewhere... Perhaps the *number* and *display* symbols were designed to prevent this convergence? ... No reasonable person would think that the *number* and *display* did not both come from the same *source*. ... Right now, the *number* and *display* are displayed as synonyms, but that will *end up* being the case for *all* numbers in the lexicon. ... Now that we have a lexicon, I can say with *confidence* that the *number* and *display* symbols were not created equal.

It's all too easy for statistical computing to be regarded as a back-end administrative task. But in many cases statistical computing can be regarded as a front-end graphical task.
