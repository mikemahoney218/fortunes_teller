You may be tempted to ask how I know this is not an example of the manual. Probably the author of the following manual pages had forgotten what his purpose for using the word 'excel' was; perhaps some of the examples taken from the manual are from the NLP or similar package. I am a bit of an 'open' on 'theoretical systems' (and other 'system' concepts) in that I think we can be a bit more liberally'ed than we usually are'ed. It is for this reason that I have treated 'System' and 'machine' as synonyms in this sense. I am tempted to use the term 'machine' (or 'excel') with this in mind whenever I see such a usage of the word 'system'.
