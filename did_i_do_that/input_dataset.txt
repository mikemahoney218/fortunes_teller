1. We are born and we die. No one cares, no one remembers, and it doesn't matter. This is why we laugh.
2. Our pack, our children, our territory, the hunt, the kill, the battle. Health, full stomach, sharp weapons, your packmates next to you under the stars, seeing your child kill her first prey. These are important.
3. Anything else is needless complication, no matter how much fun it is.
4. If you can't eat it, wear it, wield it, or carry it, leave it behind.
5. Plan before hunting, discuss after hunting, hunt while hunting.
6. Lead, follow, or hunt alone. Success-first meat of kill, greater trust. Failure-less trust. Disaster-survivors eat you.

Some people say, 'How can you live without knowing?' I do not know what they mean. I always live without knowing. That is easy. How you get to know is what I want to know.

Good actions give strength to ourselves and inspire good actions in others.
Nothing is so strong as gentleness. Nothing is so gentle as real strength.
The real man smiles in trouble, gathers strength from distress, and grows brave by reflection.
Once you choose hope, anything's possible.
Were it not for hope the heart would break.
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up.
No winter lasts forever; no spring skips it's turn.
Open your heart -- open it wide; someone is standing outside.

All the so-called "secrets of success" will not work unless you do.
Occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely explained by those symbols called words. Their meanings can only be articulated by the inaudible language of the heart.
We are all in the same boat in a stormy sea, and we owe each other a terrible loyalty.
The best things in life are never rationed. Friendship, loyalty, love, do not require coupons.
It is better to be faithful than famous.
The test of courage comes when we are in the minority. The test of tolerance comes when we are in the majority.
To sit patiently with a yearning that has not yet been fulfilled, and to trust that, that fulfillment will come, is quite possibly one of the most powerful "magic skills" that human beings are capable of. It has been noted by almost every ancient wisdom tradition.
Life has meaning only if one barters it day by day for something other than itself.
No one is more cherished in this world than someone who lightens the burden of another.
I can live for two months on a good compliment.
No one's head aches when he is comforting another.
The value of compassion cannot be over-emphasized. Anyone can criticize. It takes a true believer to be compassionate. No greater burden can be borne by an individual than to know no one cares or understands.
Compassion is sometimes the fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It is the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too.
Consult not your fears but your hopes and your dreams. Think not about your frustrations, but about your unfulfilled potential. Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do.
Life is full of beauty. Notice it. Notice the bumble bee, the small child, and the smiling faces. Smell the rain, and feel the wind. Live your life to the fullest potential, and fight for your dreams.
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts.
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them.
Be a good listener. Your ears will never get you in trouble.
To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe.
Dreams come in a size too big so that we may grow into them.
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.
If one dream should fall and break into a thousand pieces, never be afraid to pick one of those pieces up and begin again.
Gracefulness has been defined to be the outward expression of the inward harmony of the soul.
Within sorrow is grace. When we come close to those things that break us down, we touch those things that also break us open. And in that breaking open, we uncover our true nature.
When you have a sense of your own identity and a vision of where you want to go in your life, you then have the basis for reaching out to the world and going after your dreams for a better life.
What ever beauty may be, it has for its basis order, and for its essence unity.
A mind is a fire to be kindled, not a vessel to be filled.
To be good is noble, but to teach others how to be good is nobler--and less trouble.
Take control of your destiny. Believe in yourself. Ignore those who try to discourage you. Avoid negative sources, people, places, things and habits. Don't give up and don't give in.
When spider webs unite they can tie up a lion.
Therefore hold to the things which are reliable. Look to simplicity; embrace purity; Lessen the self; diminish desire.
My belief is that personal freedom cannot grow beyond personal responsibility. The more people that learn to be fully accountable for their lives, the more freedom each of us can enjoy and the more fulfilling all of our lives will be.
The need for devotion to something outside ourselves is even more profound than the need for companionship. If we are not to go to pieces or wither away, we must have some purpose in life; for no man can live for himself alone.
Above all be of single aim; have a legitimate and useful purpose, and devote yourself unreservedly to it.
Whatever I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all my heart to do it well; whatever I have devoted myself to, I have devoted myself completely; in great aims and in small I have always thoroughly been in earnest.
We learn more by looking for the answer to a question and not finding it than we do from learning the answer itself.
Tell me and I'll forget; show me and I may remember; involve me and I'll understand.
I am a part of all that I have met.
Only a life lived for others is worth living.
Only he can understand what a farm is, what a country is, who shall have sacrificed part of himself to his farm or country, fought to save it, struggled to make it beautiful. Only then will the love of farm or country fill his heart.
The wise man belongs to all countries, for the home of a great soul is the whole world.
Diversity is the one true thing we all have in common. Celebrate it every day.
As man draws nearer to the stars, why should he not also draw nearer to his neighbor?
Infinitely more important than sharing one's material wealth is sharing the wealth of ourselves, our time and energy, our passion and commitment, and, above all, our love.
By sharing something, I realized that I'm not alone, that there are a lot of people that share with me the same preoccupations, the same ideas, the same ideals, and the same quest for a meaning for this life.
It's not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for something. May I suggest that it be creating joy for others, sharing what we have for the betterment of personkind, bringing hope to the lost and love to the lonely.
There is something more -- the spirit, or the soul. I think that that quality encourages our courtesy and care and our minds. And mercy, and identity.
I place a high moral value on the way people behave. I find it repellent to have a lot, and to behave with anything other than courtesy in the old sense of the word -- politeness of the heart, a gentleness of the spirit.
Character is the total of thousands of small daily strivings to live up to the best that is in us.
With courage you will dare to take risks, have the strength to be compassionate, and the wisdom to be humble. Courage is the foundation of integrity.
Courage is almost a contradiction in terms: it means a strong desire to live taking the form of readiness to die.
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe.
Life means to have something definite to do, a mission to fulfilled and in the measure in which we avoid setting our life to something, we make it empty. Human life, by its very nature, has to be dedicated to something.
Dedicate some of your life to others. Your dedication will not be a sacrifice. It will be an exhilarating experience because it is an intense effort applied toward a meaningful end.
Love yourself, accept yourself, forgive yourself, and be good to yourself, because without you the rest of us are without a source of many wonderful things.
To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.
When work, commitment, and pleasure all become one and you reach that deep well where passion lives, nothing is impossible.
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn.
It was character that got us out of bed, commitment that moved us into action, and discipline that enabled us to follow through.
Reach high, for stars lie hidden in your soul. Dream deep, for every dream precedes the goal.
The road of life twists and turns and no two directions are ever the same. Yet our lessons come from the journey, not the destination.
You are here for a purpose. There is no duplicate of you in the whole wide world. There never has been, there never will be. You were brought here now to fill a certain need. Take time to think that over.
Humility leads to strength and not to weakness. It is the highest form of self-respect to admit mistakes and to make amends for them.
Sense shines with a double luster when it is set in humility. An able and yet humble man is a jewel worth a kingdom.
Dream your dream. Follow your heart. Imagine. Listen to the wind. Drink sunsets. Be free. Let the wonder never cease. Believe. Wish on EVERY star. Create adventure. Be Kind.
The best thing to give to your enemy is forgiveness; to an opponent, tolerance; to a friend, your heart; to your child, a good example; to a father, deference; to your mother, conduct that will make her proud of you; to yourself, respect; to all men, charity.
Respect is love in plain clothes.
Respect your fellow human being, treat them fairly, disagree with them honestly, enjoy their friendship, explore your thoughts about one another candidly, work together for a common goal and help one another achieve it.
When your values are clear to you, making decisions becomes easier.
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime.
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.
The keys to patience are acceptance and faith. Accept things as they are, and look realistically at the world around you. Have faith in yourself and in the direction you have chosen.
People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in their true beauty is revealed only if there is light from within.
Confidence, like art, never comes from having all the answers; it comes from being open to all the questions.
Confidence...thrives on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection and on unselfish performance. Without them it cannot live.
Laugh at yourself, but don't ever aim your doubt at yourself. Be bold. When you embark for strange places, don't leave any of yourself safely on shore. Have the nerve to go into unexplored territory.
Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love.
Hold yourself responsible for a higher standard than anybody else expects of you, never excuse yourself.
If you take responsibility for yourself you will develop a hunger to accomplish your dreams.
You can turn painful situations around through laughter. If you can find humor in anything, even poverty, you can survive it.
A kind heart is a fountain of gladness, making everything in its vicinity freshen into smiles.
Our character...is an omen of our destiny, and the more integrity we have and keep, the simpler and nobler that destiny is likely to be.
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity.
Integrity is not a conditional word. It doesn't blow in the wind or change with the weather. It is your inner image of yourself, and if you look in there and see a man who won't cheat, then you know he never will.
Parents, teach your children to express themselves. Teach them to be in touch with their emotions, to speak honestly to people, and to maintain integrity and stick by their principles in all they do. This is perhaps the highest morality you can instill.
Don't wait for extraordinary opportunities. Seize common occasions and make them great. Weak men wait for opportunities; strong men make them.
There will always be a frontier where there is an open mind and a willing hand.
A great attitude does much more than turn on the lights in our worlds; it seems to magically connect us to all sorts of serendipitous opportunities that were somehow absent before the change.
Start where you are. Distant fields always look greener, but opportunity lies right where you are. Take advantage of every opportunity of service.
Challenges are what make life interesting; overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.
The most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create, to overcome, to endure, to transform, to love and to be greater than our suffering.
The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; it is dearness only that gives everything its value. I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection.
Be willing to have it so. Acceptance of what has happened is the first step to overcoming the consequences of any misfortune.
If we study the lives of great men and women carefully and unemotionally we find that, invariably, greatness was developed, tested and revealed through the darker periods of their lives. One of the largest tributaries of the River of Greatness is always the Stream of Adversity.
It doesn't matter who you are, where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. Always.
I do believe that when we face challenges in life that are far beyond our own power, it's an opportunity to build on our faith, inner strength, and courage. I've learned that how we face challenges plays a big role in the outcome of them.
Greatness lies, not in being strong, but in the right using of strength; and strength is not used rightly when it serves only to carry a man above his fellows for his own solitary glory. He is the greatest whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own.
Hope is the dream of a soul awake.
When the world says, 'Give up,' hope whispers, 'Try it one more time.'
Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; but remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.
We are all functioning at a small fraction of our capacity to live life fully in its total meaning of loving, caring, creating, and adventuring. Consequently, the actualizing of our potential can become the most exciting adventure of our lifetime.
Extend to each person, no matter how trivial the contact, all the care and kindness and understanding and love that you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again.
Do not wait; the time will never be 'just right'. Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.
Put your heart, mind, intellect and soul even to your smallest acts. This is the secret of success.
Some people grumble because roses have thorns; I am thankful that the thorns have roses.
Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.
Gratitude bestows reverence, allowing us to encounter everyday epiphanies, those transcendent moments of awe that change forever how we experience life and the world.
Each friend represents a world in us, a world possibly not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born.
You have been my friend. That in itself is a tremendous thing... By helping you, perhaps I was trying to lift up my life a trifle. Heaven knows anyone's life can stand a little of that.
I believe that friends are quiet angels who sit on our shoulders and lift our wings when we forget how to fly.
Friendship doubles our joy and divides our grief.
The most important key to achieving great success is to decide upon your goal and launch, get started, take action, move.
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in.
A man without ambition is dead. A man with ambition but no love is dead. A man with ambition and love for his blessings here on earth is ever so alive.
We must have a theme, a goal, a purpose in our lives. If you don't know where you're aiming, you don't have a goal. My goal is to live my life in such a way that when I die, someone can say, she cared.
To do something, however small, to make others happier and better, is the highest ambition, the most elevating hope, which can inspire a human being.
No more duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions.
Goals. There's not telling what you can do when you get inspired by them. There's no telling what you can do when you believe in them. There's no telling what will happen when you act upon them.
If I have been of service, if I have glimpsed more of the nature and essence of ultimate good, if I am inspired to reach wider horizons of thought and action, if I am at peace with myself, it has been a successful day.
A smile is the beginning of peace.
This is the way of peace: Overcome evil with good, falsehood with truth, and hatred with love.
We shall find peace. We shall hear angels. We shall see the sky sparkling with diamonds.
Peace is not something you wish for; It's something you make, Something you do, Something you are, And something you give away.
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.
Follow your heart, but be quiet for a while first. Ask questions, then feel the answer. Learn to trust your heart.
Remember, there are no mistakes, only lessons. Love yourself, trust your choices, and everything is possible.
Trust in what you love, continue to do it, and it will take you where you need to go.
Dare to be true: nothing can need a lie: A fault, which needs it most, grows two thereby.
A person is not given integrity. It results from the relentless pursuit of honesty at all times.
Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.
Don't worry so much about your self- esteem. Worry more about your character. Integrity is its own reward.
Compassion is the desire that moves the individual self to widen the scope of its self-concern to embrace the whole of the universal self.
Giving connects two people, the giver and the receiver, and this connection gives birth to a new sense of belonging.
Compassion is the ultimate and most meaningful embodiment of emotional maturity. It is through compassion that a person achieves the highest peak and deepest reach in his or her search for self-fulfillment.
If you realized how powerful your thoughts are, you would never think a negative thought.
A word of encouragement during a failure is worth more than an hour of praise after success.
One of the sanest, surest, and most generous joys of life comes from being happy over the good fortune of others.
Make it a habit to tell people thank you. To express your appreciation, sincerely and without the expectation of anything in return. Truly appreciate those around you, and you'll soon find many others around you. Truly appreciate life, and you'll find that you have more of it.
Let me not hurt, by any selfish deed, Or thoughtless word, the heart of foe or friend; Nor would I pass, unseeing, worthy need, Or sin by silence when I should defend... 'The world is better that I lived to-day.'
We must not, in trying to think about how we can make a big difference, ignore the small daily differences we can make which, over time, add up to big differences that we often cannot foresee.
Your vocation in life is where your greatest joy meets the world's greatest need.
Each day when I awake I know I have one more day to make a difference in someone's life.
Listening is such a simple act. It requires us to be present, and that takes practice, but we don't have to do anything else. We don't have to advise, or coach, or sound wise. We just have to be willing to sit there and listen.
Wisdom is the reward you get for a lifetime of listening when you'd have preferred to talk.
Listening is an attitude of the heart, a genuine desire to be with another which both attracts and heals.
The greatest compliment that was ever paid me was when one asked me what I thought, and attended to my answer.
I remind myself every morning: Nothing I say this day will teach me anything. So if I'm going to learn, I must do it by listening.
Set out each day believing in your dreams. Know without a doubt that you were made for amazing things.
The work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives and the dreams shall never die.
One isn't necessarily born with courage, but one is born with potential. Without courage, we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency. We can't be kind, true, merciful, generous, or honest.

Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there.
There can only be one state of mind as you approach any profound test; total concentration, a spirit of togetherness, and strength.

There are no problems we cannot solve together, and very few that we can solve by ourselves.
Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself.
The world is but a canvas to the imagination.
Friends are helpful not only because they will listen to us, but because they will laugh at us; Through them we learn a little objectivity, a little modesty, a little courtesy; We learn the rules of life and become better players of the game.

that like most books, it had too many words.  The plot was the same one that

women.  There, that's it: 24 words.  But the guy who wrote the book took
*thousands* of words to say it.

Or maybe only one of them kills the father.  It's impossible to tell because

down here.  I might have just the thing for you.  Yes, here we are!
Look at that, isn't it neat?  Now that is a FrintArms product as well,

spoil the line of a jacket; and you won't feel you're lugging half a
tonne of iron around with you.  We do a range of matching accessories,
including -- if I may say so -- a rather saucy garter holster.  Wish I

charged battery, charging unit, beautiful glider-hide shoulder holster
with adjustable fitting and contrast stitching, and a discount on your
next battery.  Full instructions, of course, and a voucher for free
lessons at your local gun club or range.  Or there's the *special*
presentation pack; it has all the other one's got but with *two*
charged batteries and a night-sight, too.  Here, feel that -- don't
worry, it's a dummy battery -- isn't it neat?  Feel how light it is?
Smooth, see?  No bits to stick out and catch on your clothes, *and*
beautifully balanced.  And of course the beauty of a laser is, there's
no recoil.  Because it's shooting light, you see?  Beautiful gun,
beautiful gun; my wife has one.  Really.  That's not a line, she
really has.  Now, I can do you that one -- with a battery and a free
charge -- for ninety-five; or the presentation pack on a special
offer for one-nineteen; or this, the special presentation pack, for
one-forty-nine."

to a doctrine not only known to be false, but calculated to undermine any
general understanding of science as an enterprise?
"Deep" is a word like "theory" or "semantic" ― it implies all sorts of

The brain is a beautifully engineered get-out-of-the-way machine that
constantly scans the environment for things out of whose way it should
right now get. That's what brains did for several hundred million years ―
and then, just a few million years ago, the mammalian brain learned a new
trick: to predict the timing and location of dangers before they actually
happened.
Our ability to duck that which is not yet coming is one of the brain's most
stunning innovations, and we wouldn't have dental floss or 401(k) plans
without it. But this innovation is in the early stages of development. The
application that allows us to respond to visible baseballs is ancient and

loom in an unseen future is still in beta testing.

... But if we laugh with derision, we will never understand. Human
intellectual capacity has not altered for thousands of years so far as we
can tell. If intelligent people invested intense energy in issues that now
seem foolish to us, then the failure lies in our understanding of their
world, not in their distorted perceptions. Even the standard example of
ancient nonsense ― the debate about angels on pinheads ― makes sense once
you realize that theologians were not discussing whether five or eighteen
would fit, but whether a pin could house a finite or an infinite number.
... Fortunately, the responsibility for providing evidence is on the part of
the person making the claim, not the critic. It is not the responsibility
of UFO skeptics to prove that a UFO has never existed, nor is it the
responsibility of paranormal-health-claims skeptics to prove that crystals
or colored lights never healed anyone. The skeptic's role is to point out
claims that are not adequately supported by acceptable evidence and to
provide plausible alternative explanations that are more in keeping with
the accepted body of scientific evidence. ...
... Had this been an actual emergency, we would have fled in terror,

... The book is worth attention for only two reasons: (1) it attacks
attempts to expose sham paranormal studies; and (2) it is very well and
plausibly written and so rather harder to dismiss or refute by simple
jeering.
The first principle is that you must not fool yourself―and you are the
easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After
you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You
just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.

flyblown rhetoric of Bishop Wilberforce and William Jennings Bryan.
...computer hardware progress is so fast. No other technology since
civilization began has seen six orders of magnitude in performance-price
gain in 30 years.
...difference of opinion is advantageous in religion. The several sects
perform the office of a common censor morum over each other. Is uniformity
attainable? Millions of innocent men, women, and children, since the
introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned;
yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity.
...it still remains true that as a set of cognitive beliefs about the
existence of God in any recognizable sense continuous with the great
systems of the past, religious doctrines constitute a speculative
hypothesis of an extremely low order of probability.

A famous Lisp Hacker noticed an Undergraduate sitting in front of a Xerox
1108, trying to edit a complex Klone network via a browser. Wanting to
help, the Hacker clicked one of the nodes in the network with the mouse,
and asked "what do you see?" Very earnestly, the Undergraduate replied "I
see a cursor." The Hacker then quickly pressed the boot toggle at the back
of the keyboard, while simultaneously hitting the Undergraduate over the
head with a thick Interlisp Manual. The Undergraduate was then Enlightened.

A little retrospection shows that although many fine, useful software systems
have been designed by committees and built as part of multipart projects,
those software systems that have excited passionate fans are those that are
the products of one or a few designing minds, great designers. Consider Unix,

with Cobol, PL/I, Algol, MVS/370, and MS-DOS.

Albert Einstein, when asked to describe radio, replied: "You see, wire
telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New
York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And
radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive
them there. The only difference is that there is no cat."

All programmers are optimists. Perhaps this modern sorcery especially attracts
those who believe in happy endings and fairy godmothers. Perhaps the hundreds
of nitty frustrations drive away all but those who habitually focus on the end
goal. Perhaps it is merely that computers are young, programmers are younger,
and the young are always optimists. But however the selection process works,
the result is indisputable: "This time it will surely run," or "I just found
the last bug."
All progress is based upon a universal innate desire on the part of

And the crowd was stilled. One elderly man, wondering at the sudden silence,
turned to the Child and asked him to repeat what he had said. Wide-eyed,

As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't
as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be
discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large
part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in
my own programs.

so hard to figure out how to get the bark on.
As the system comes up, the component builders will from time to time appear,
bearing hot new versions of their pieces ― faster, smaller, more complete,
or putatively less buggy. The replacement of a working component by a new
version requires the same systematic testing procedure that adding a new
component does, although it should require less time, for more complete and
efficient test cases will usually be available.

divinity.

At first sight, the idea of any rules or principles being superimposed on
the creative mind seems more likely to hinder than to help, but this is
quite untrue in practice. Disciplined thinking focuses inspiration rather
than blinkers it.
At the heart of science is an essential tension between two seemingly
contradictory attitudes ― an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre
or counterintuitive they may be, and the most ruthless skeptical scrutiny
of all ideas, old and new. This is how deep truths are winnowed from deep
nonsense. Of course, scientists make mistakes in trying to understand the
world, but there is a built-in error-correcting mechanism: The collective
enterprise of creative thinking and skeptical thinking together keeps the
field on track.
At the source of every error which is blamed on the computer you will
find at least two human errors, including the error of blaming it on
the computer.

Certain old men prefer to rise at dawn, taking a cold bath and a long walk
with an empty stomach and otherwise mortifying the flesh. They then point
with pride to these practices as the cause of their sturdy health and ripe

applications where reliability is critical, i.e., nuclear power stations,
cruise missiles, early warning systems, anti-ballistic missle defense

error may not be an exploratory space rocket on a harmless trip to Venus:
It may be a nuclear warhead exploding over one of our cities. An unreliable

greater risk to our environment and to our society than unsafe cars, toxic
pesticides, or accidents at nuclear power stations.

Each honest calling, each walk of life, has its own elite, its own aristocracy
based on excellence of performance.
Each team building another component has been using the most recent tested
version of the integrated system as a test bed for debugging its piece. Their
work will be set back by having that test bed change under them. Of course it
must. But the changes need to be quantized. Then each user has periods of
productive stability, interrupted by bursts of test-bed change. This seems
to be much less disruptive than a constant rippling and trembling.

Every 4 seconds a woman has a baby. Our problem is to find this woman
and stop her.
Horses have an even number of legs. Behind they have two legs, and in
front they have fore-legs. This makes six legs, which is certainly an
odd number of legs for a horse. But the only number that is both even
and odd is infinity. Therefore, horses have an infinite number of
legs. Now to show this for the general case, suppose that somewhere,
there is a horse that has a finite number of legs. But that is a horse
of another color, and by the [above] lemma ["All horses are the same
color"], that does not exist.
Every Solidarity center had piles and piles of paper .... everyone was
eating paper and a policeman was at the door. Now all you have to do is
bend a disk.
Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired
signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not
fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not
spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the
genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way
of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is
humanity hanging on a cross of iron.
Every program has at least one bug and can be shortened by at least one

solids in the universe. There's not even a suggestion of a solid. There
are no absolute continuums. There are no surfaces. There are no straight
lines.
Only a spiritually bankrupt society could ever believe it. ... Only
atheists could accept this Satanic theory.
Evolution does not require the nonexistence of God, it merely allows for
it. That alone is enough to evoke condemnation from those who fear the

united with it, she is the mother of the arts and the origin of marvels.
Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though
checkered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither
enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in the gray twilight that knows
not victory or defeat.
Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it
every six months.
Felson's Law: To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism; to steal from
many is research.
Finagle's First Law: If an experiment works, something has gone wrong.
Finagle's Second Law: Once a job is fouled up, anything done to improve it
only makes it worse.
Finding the occasional straw of truth awash in a great ocean of confusion and
bamboozle requires intelligence, vigilance, dedication and courage. But if we
don't practice these tough habits of thought, we cannot hope to solve the truly
serious problems that face us ― and we risk becoming a nation of suckers, up
for grabs by the next charlatan who comes along.
Fine, Java MIGHT be a good example of what a programming language should be
like. But Java applications are good examples of what applications
SHOULDN'T be like.
Finster's Law: a closed mouth gathers no feet.
First Law of Procrastination: Procrastination shortens the job and places
the responsibility for its termination on someone else (i.e., the authority
who imposed the deadline).
First Law of Socio-Genetics: Celibacy is not hereditary.
First Rule of History: History doesn't repeat itself, historians merely
repeat each other.
Football combines the two worst features of American life: violence and
committee meetings.
For a while there I was worried that my tin foil beanie was blocking the
TopFive.com website. Luckily it turned out to be a router problem.
For an idea to be fashionable is ominous, since it must afterwards be
always old-fashioned.
For some reason a glaze passes over people's faces when you say
"Canada". Maybe we should invade South Dakota or something.
For the politicians this was never about how efficient they could make
things happen or how to solve a problem, it is about the *appearance* of
efficiency, or problem solving. My observation is that most politicians
think more like sales people than technicians, and are about as clueful.
Which means, unless the politicians change the way they think, discussion
about how to use *them* to go about really solving these problems would be
like asking a booth babe to write a kernel module.
Forgetfulness, n.: A gift of God bestowed upon debtors in compensation for
their destitution of conscience.
Fourth Law of Revision: It is usually impractical to worry beforehand about
interferences ― if you have none, someone will make one for you.
If the probability of success is not almost one, then it is damn near zero.
Frisbeetarianism, n.: The belief that when you die, your soul goes up on the
roof and gets stuck.
Usually abbreviated to FROB. Thus one has the saying "to frob a
frob". See TWEAK and TWIDDLE. Usage: FROB, TWIDDLE, and TWEAK
sometimes connote points along a continuum. FROB connotes aimless
manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes gross manipulation, often a coarse
search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes fine-tuning. If someone is
turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it
he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the
screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it because
turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.
From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern

Froud's Law: A transistor protected by a fast acting fuse will protect the
fuse by blowing first.
Fudd's First Law of Opposition: Push something hard enough and it will

Furbling, v.: Having to wander through a maze of ropes at an airport or bank
even when you are the only person in line.

G. B. Shaw to William Douglas Home: "Go on writing plays, my boy. One
of these days a London producer will go into his office and say to his
secretary, `Is there a play from Shaw this morning?' and when she says
`No,' he will say, `Well, then we'll have to start on the rubbish.'
Garbage In ― Gospel Out.
Garter, n.: An elastic band intended to keep a woman from coming out of her
stockings and desolating the country.
Genderplex, n.: The predicament of a person in a restaurant who is unable to
determine his or her designated restroom (e.g., turtles and tortoises).
Genetics explains why you look like your father, and if you don't, why
you should.
Geology shows that fossils are of different ages. Paleontology shows a
fossil sequence, the list of species represented changes through time.
Taxonomy shows biological relationships among species. Evolution is the
explanation that threads it all together. Creationism is the practice of
squeeezing one's eyes shut and wailing, "Does not!"
Get forgiveness now ― tomorrow you may no longer feel guilty.
Give a small boy a hammer and he will find that everything he encounters needs
pounding.
Give me a plumber's friend the size of the Pittsburgh Dome, and a place
to stand, and I will drain the world.
Glib's Fourth Law of Unreliability: Investment in reliability will increase
until it exceeds the probable cost of errors, or until someone insists on
getting some useful work done.
Go placidly amid the noise and waste, and remember what value there may
be in owning a piece thereof.
God did not create the world in 7 days; he screwed around for 6 days
and then pulled an all-nighter.
God has intended the great to be great and the little to be little ... The
trade unions, under the European system, destroy liberty ... I do not mean
to say that a dollar a day is enough to support a workingman ... not enough
to support a man and five children if he insists on smoking and drinking
beer. But the man who cannot live on bread and water is not fit to live!
A family may live on good bread and water in the morning, water and bread
at midday, and good bread and water at night!
God is really only another artist. He invented the giraffe, the elephant
and the cat. He has no real style, He just goes on trying other things.
God runs electromagnetics by wave theory on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,
and the Devil runs them by quantum theory on Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday.
Godwin's Law: As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a
comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.
Going to church does not make a person religious, nor does going to school
make a person educated, any more than going to a garage makes a person a car.
Good advice is something a man gives when he is too old to set a bad
example.
Goto, n.: A programming tool that exists to allow structured programmers
to complain about unstructured programmers.
Graduate life ― it's not just a job, it's an indenture.
Granholm's Definition of the Kludge: An ill-assorted collection of poorly
matching parts forming a distressing whole.
Great people talk about ideas, average people talk about things, and small
people talk about wine.
Greener's Law: Never argue with a man who buys ink by the barrel.
Grelb's Reminder: Eighty percent of all people consider themselves to be above
average drivers.
Hacker's Law: The belief that enhanced understanding will necessarily stir
a nation to action is one of mankind's oldest illusions.
Haggis is a kind of stuffed black pudding eaten by the Scots and considered
by them to be not only a delicacy but fit for human consumption. The minced
heart, liver and lungs of a sheep, calf or other animal's inner organs are
mixed with oatmeal, sealed and boiled in maw in the sheep's intestinal
stomach-bag and ... Excuse me a minute ...
Half the things that people do not succeed in are through fear of making
the attempt.
Hand, n.: A singular instrument worn at the end of a human arm and
commonly thrust into somebody's pocket.
Hanlon's Razor: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately
explained by stupidity.
Happiness, n.: An agreeable sensation arising from contemplating the misery of
another.
Happiness: An agreeable sensation arising from contemplating the misery
of another.
Hardware, n.: The parts of a computer system that can be kicked.
Harrisberger's Second Law of the Lab: No matter what result it anticipated,
there is always someone willing to fake it.
Harrisberger's Third Law of the Lab: Experiments should be reproducive.
They should all fail in the same way.
Harrisberger's Fourth Law of the Lab: Experience is directly proportional
to the amount of equipment ruined.
Hartley's Second Law: Never sleep with anyone crazier than yourself.
Harvard Law: Under the most rigorously controlled conditions of pressure,
temperature, volume, humidity, and other variables, the organism will do as
it damn well pleases.
Has everyone noticed that all the letters of the word "database" are
typed with the left hand? Now the layout of the QWERTYUIOP typewriter
keyboard was designed, among other things, to facilitate the even use
of both hands. It follows, therefore, that writing about databases is
not only unnatural, but a lot harder than it appears.
Hatred, n.: A sentiment appropriate to the occasion of another's superiority.
Have you ever noticed that the people who are always trying to tell you,
"There's a time for work and a time for play," never find the time for play?
Have you noticed that all you need to grow healthy, vigorous grass is a
crack in your sidewalk?
He had that rare weird electricity about him ― that extremely wild and
heavy presence that you only see in a person who has abandoned all hope
of ever behaving "normally."
He hated to mend, so young Ned
Called in a cute neighbor instead.
Did you have to bite off the thread?"
He launched a massive attack on everything this country held inviolate, on
most of what it held self-evident. He showed how our politics was dominated
by time-servers and demagogues, our religion by bigots, our culture by
puritans. He showed how the average citizen, both in himself and in the
way he let himself be pulled around by the nose, was a boob.
He wasn't much of an actor, he wasn't much of a Governor ― Hell, they
HAD to make him President of the United States. It's the only job he's
qualified for!
He who attacks the fundamentals of the American broadcasting industry
attacks democracy itself.
He who invents adages for others to peruse takes along rowboat when going on
cruise.
He who laughs, lasts.
He's the kind of guy, that, well, if you were ever in a jam he'd be
there ... with two slices of bread and some chunky peanut butter.
Heaven, n.: A place where the wicked cease from troubling you with talk of
their personal affairs, and the good listen with attention while you
expound your own.

Here I am, fifty-eight, and I still don't know what I want to be when I grow
up.
Heuristics are bug ridden by definition. If they didn't have bugs,
then they'd be algorithms.
Hi there! This is just a note from me, to you, to tell you, the person
reading this note, that I can't think up any more famous quotes, jokes,
nor bizarre stories, so you may as well go home.
The griffin was itself a compound creature, half lion and half eagle.
The hippogriff was actually, therefore, only one quarter eagle, which
is two dollars and fifty cents in gold. The study of zoology is full
of surprises.
History has the relation to truth that theology has to religion ―
i.e., none to speak of.
History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people
maintaining a free civil government. This marks the lowest grade of
ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will
always avail themselves for their own purpose.
History shows that the human mind, fed by constant accessions of knowledge,
periodically grows too large for its theoretical coverings, and bursts them
asunder to appear in new habiliments, as the feeding and growing grub, at
intervals, casts its too narrow skin and assumes another... Truly the
imago state of Man seems to be terribly distant, but every moult is a step
gained.
Hlade's Law: If you have a difficult task, give it to a lazy person ― they
will find an easier way to do it.
Hoare's Law of Large Problems: Inside every large problem is a
small problem struggling to get out.
Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take
Hofstadter's Law into account.
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no substitute for a good blaster at
your side.
Honorable, adj.: Afflicted with an impediment in one's reach. In legislative
bodies, it is customary to mention all members as honorable; as, "the honorable
gentleman is a scurvy cur."
Horngren's Observation: Among economists, the real world is often a special
case.
Q. How long does it take a DEC field service engineer to change a lightbulb?
A. It depends on how many bad ones he brought with him.
A. "That's a known problem... don't worry about it."
A. Three: one to screw it in and two to say "I told you so" when it doesn't
A. "Well the diagnostics say it's fine buddy, so it's a software problem."
Howe's Law: Everyone has a scheme that will not work.
However, never daunted, I will cope with adversity in my traditional
manner ... sulking and nausea.
Human cardiac catheterization was introduced by Werner Forssman in 1929.
Ignoring his department chief, and tying his assistant to an operating
table to prevent his interference, he placed a uretheral catheter into a
vein in his arm, advanced it to the right atrium [of his heart], and walked
upstairs to the x-ray department where he took the confirmatory x-ray film.
In 1956, Dr. Forssman was awarded the Nobel Prize.
Humanity has the stars in its future, and that future is too important to be
lost under the burden of juvenile folly and ignorant superstition.
Hurewitz's Memory Principle: The chance of forgetting something is directly
proportional to ..... to ........ uh ..............
I always distrust people who know so much about what God wants them to do to
their fellows.
I have found Christian dogma unintelligible. Early in life, I absented myself
from Christian assemblies.
I have had interactions with developers who are convinced that everything in
.Net was created solely by MS for open source usage. But that could be another
result of vaccination preservatives.
I think all right-thinking people in this country are sick and tired of being
told that ordinary, decent people are fed up in this country with being sick
and tired. I'm certainly not! And I'm sick and tired of being told that I am.
I would defend the liberty of concenting adult creationists to practice
whatever intellectual perversions they like in the privacy of their own
homes; but it is also necessary to protect the young and innocent.
I would not dare to so dishonor my Creator God by attaching His name to
that book [the Bible].
I'm also not very analytical. You know, I don't spend a lot of time thinking
about myself, about why I do things.
I'm an evolutionist because I judge the evidence for the unity of life by
common descent over billions of years to be overwhelming, not so that I can
cheat on my wife or kick the cat with impunity. I live in no hope of heaven
or fear of hell, but like most of my fellow Americans of all religious
persuasions, I try to live a decent life. Folks like Tom DeLay just can't
get it through their heads that a person can choose to live ethically
because civilized life requires doing unto others as you would have them do
unto you.
I am a member of a party of one, and I live in an age of fear. Nothing
lately has unsettled my party and raised my fears so much as your
editorial, on Thanksgiving Day, suggesting that employees should be
required to state their beliefs in order to hold their jobs. The idea is
inconsistent with our constitutional theory and has been stubbornly opposed
by watchful men since the early days of the Republic.
I am astounded ... at the wonderful power you have developed ― and terrified
at the thought that so much hideous and bad music may be put on record
forever.
I am ready to meet my Maker. Whether my Maker is prepared for the
great ordeal of meeting me is another matter.
I am, in point of fact, a particularly haughty and exclusive person, of
pre-Adamite ancestral descent. You will understand this when I tell you
that I can trace my ancestry back to a protoplasmal primordial atomic
globule. Consequently, my family pride is something inconceivable. I can't
help it. I was born sneering.
Without a belief in human unity I am hungry and incomplete. Human unity
is the fulfillment of diversity. It is the harmony of opposites. It is
a many-stranded texture, with color and depth.
I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than
you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods,
you will understand why I dismiss yours.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish Church, by the Roman
Church, by the Greek Church, by the Turkish Church, by the Protestant Church,
nor by any Church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
I do not believe that this generation of Americans is willing to resign itself
to going to bed each night by the light of a Communist moon...
I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us
with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.
I do not mind what language an opera is sung in so long as it is a language
I don't understand.
I don't believe in astrology. But then I'm an Aquarius, and Aquarians
don't believe in astrology.
I dread success. To have succeeded is to have finished one's business
on earth, like the male spider, who is killed by the female the moment
he has succeeded in his courtship. I like a state of continual
becoming, with a goal in front and not behind.
I dream of a better tomorrow, where chickens can cross the road and not be
questioned about their motives.
I get the feeling that as soon as something appears in the paper, it ceases to
be true.
I glance at the headlines just to kind of get a flavor for what's moving.
I rarely read the stories, and get briefed by people who are probably read
the news themselves.
I haven't lost my mind ― it's backed up on tape somewhere.
I judge a religion as being good or bad based on whether its adherents
become better people as a result of practicing it.
I maintain there is much more wonder in science than in pseudoscience. And
in addition, to whatever measure this term has any meaning, science has the
additional virtue, and it is not an inconsiderable one, of being true.
I never fail to convince an audience that the best thing they could do
was to go away.
I put the shotgun in an Adidas bag and padded it out with four pairs of tennis
socks, not my style at all, but that was what I was aiming for: If they think
you're crude, go technical; if they think you're technical, go crude. I'm a
very technical boy. So I decided to get as crude as possible. These days,
though, you have to be pretty technical before you can even aspire to
crudeness.
I regret to say that we of the F.B.I. are powerless to act in cases of
oral-genital intimacy, unless it has in some way obstructed interstate
commerce.
I regret to say that we of the FBI are powerless to act in cases of
I simply try to aid in letting the light of historical truth into that decaying
mass of outworn thought which attaches the modern world to medieval conceptions
of Christianity, and which still lingers among us―a most serious barrier to
religion and morals, and a menace to the whole normal evolution of society.
I think people are reacting to what they perceive to be your simplistic and
fetishistic understanding of the economy, which is becoming more and more
pronouncedly so in its outward manifestations as you react to your
misunderstanding of people's reactions to your reaction to what you perceived
as Sam's simplistic and fetishistic understanding of the economy.
I think time is crucial to anything. For example, if you lock an infinite
number of monkeys in a room with those typewriters, but you limit the
amount of time they have to write, the best you'll get out of them is the
pilot to The Dukes of Hazzard.
I think trash is the most important manifestation of culture we have in my
lifetime.
I was brought up in the other service; but I knew from the first that the
Devil was my natural master and captain and friend. I saw that he was in
the right, and that the world cringed to his conqueror only from fear.
I was in this prematurely air conditioned supermarket and there were all
these aisles and there were these bathing caps you could buy that had these
kind of Fourth of July plumes on them that were red and yellow and blue and
I wasn't tempted to buy one but I was reminded of the fact that I had been
avoiding the beach.
I went on to test the program in every way I could devise. I strained
it to expose its weaknesses. I ran it for high-mass stars and low-mass
stars, for stars born exceedingly hot and those born relatively cold.
I ran it assuming the superfluid currents beneath the crust to be
absent ― not because I wanted to know the answer, but because I had
developed an intuitive feel for the answer in this particular case.
Finally I got a run in which the computer showed the pulsar's
temperature to be less than absolute zero. I had found an error. I
chased down the error and fixed it. Now I had improved the program to
the point where it would not run at all.
Few companies really work like the Borg.  Most work a lot more like the Holy
Roman Empire. News often takes weeks to travel from castle to castle by
minstrel.
[The Ramones'] "I Wanna Be Sedated" should be played loud, poorly, and in
some dingy club where you'd get grounded if your folks found out you were
there, not quietly while strolling down the freezer aisle.
I will contend that conceptual integrity is *the* most important consideration
in system design.
I wish there was a knob on the TV to turn up the intelligence. There's
a knob called "brightness", but it doesn't work.
I would defend the liberty of consenting adult creationists to practice
I would have promised those terrorists a trip to Disneyland if it would have
gotten the hostages released. I thank God they were satisfied with the
missiles and we didn't have to go to that extreme.
I wouldn't mind dying ― it's that business of having to stay dead that
scares the shit out of me.
I'll tell you what kind of guy I was. If you ordered a boxcar full of
sons-of-bitches and opened the door and only found me inside, you could
consider the order filled.
I've seen many politicians paralyzed in the legs as myself, but I've seen more
of them who were paralyzed in the head.
Idiot Box, n.: The part of the envelope that tells a person where to place the
stamp when they can't quite figure it out for themselves.
Idiot, n.: A member of a large and powerful tribe whose influence in human
affairs has always been dominant and controlling.
If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves
upon execution.
If Jesus Christ were to come today, people would not even crucify him. They
would ask him to dinner, and hear what he had to say, and make fun of it.
If Murphy's Law were true, every time you tried to take a breath, all the
air would be on the other side of the room.
If a group of N persons implements a COBOL compiler, there will be N-1

If a listener nods his head when you're explaining your program, wake
him up.
If a person (a) is poorly, (b) receives treatment intended to make him better,
and (c) gets better, then no power of reasoning known to medical science can
convince him that it may not have been the treatment that restored his health.
If all else fails, immortality can always be assured by spectacular
error.
If all the philosophers in the world were laid end to end, they wouldn't
reach a conclusion.
If all the salmon caught in Canada in one year were laid end to end
across the Sahara Desert, the smell would be absolutely awful.
If all the world's economists were laid end to end, we wouldn't reach a
conclusion.
If an idea can survive a bureaucratic review and be implemented
it isn't worth the effort.
If atheism is to be used to express the state of mind in which God is
identified with the unknowable, and theology is pronounced to be a
collection of meaningless words about unintelligible chimeras, then
I have no doubt, and I think few people doubt, that atheists are as
plentiful as blackberries...
If bankers can count, how come they have eight windows and only four
tellers?
If I was a religious person, I would consider creationism nothing less than
blasphemy. Do its adherents imagine that God is a cosmic hoaxer who has
created that whole vast fossil record for the sole purpose of misleading
mankind?
If imprinted foil seal under cap is broken or missing when purchased, do not

If mathematically you end up with the wrong answer, try multiplying by

If only God would give me some clear sign! Like making a large deposit

in my name at a Swiss bank.
If only one could get that wonderful feeling of accomplishment without
having to accomplish anything.
If people were required to know the law rather than obey it, the government
would be overthrown the very next day.
If scientific reasoning were limited to the logical processes of
arithmetic, we should not get very far in our understanding of the
physical world. One might as well attempt to grasp the game of poker
entirely by the use of the mathematics of probability.
If someone were to ask me for a short cut to sensuality, I would
suggest he go shopping for a used 427 Shelby-Cobra. But it is only
fair to warn you that of the 300 guys who switched to them in 1966,
only two went back to women.
If the aborigine drafted an IQ test, all of Western civilization would
presumably flunk it.
If the bulk of American SF can be said to be written by robots, about
robots, for robots, then the bulk of English fantasy seems to be written
by rabbits, about rabbits and for rabbits.
If the odds are a million to one against something occurring, chances are
50-50 it will.
If the presence of electricity can be made visible in any part of a
circuit, I see no reason why intelligence may not be transmitted
instantaneously by electricity.
If the weather is extremely bad, church attendance will be down. If
the weather is extremely good, church attendance will be down. If the
bulletin covers are in short supply, however, church attendance will
exceed all expectations.
If there is a possibility of several things going wrong, the one that
will cause the most damage will be the one to go wrong.
If two men agree on everything, you may be sure that one of them is
doing the thinking.
If we do not change our direction we are likely to end up where we are
headed.
If we make peaceful revolution impossible, we make violent revolution
inevitiable.
If you always postpone pleasure you will never have it. Quit work and play

If you give Congress a chance to vote on both sides of an issue, it
will always do it.
If you have to push so hard that you break your penis, you are doing
something wrong.
If you make people think they're thinking, they'll love you; but if you

If you meet somebody who tells you that he loves you more than anybody
in the whole wide world, don't trust him. It means he experiments.
If you perceive that there are four possible ways in which a procedure
can go wrong, and circumvent these, then a fifth way will promptly
develop.
If you push the "extra ice" button on the soft drink vending machine,
you won't get any ice. If you push the "no ice" button, you'll get
ice, but no cup.
If you put garbage in a computer nothing comes out but garbage. But
this garbage, having passed through a very expensive machine, is
somehow ennobled and none dare criticize it.
If you substitute other kinds of intellectual property into the GNU
manifesto, it quickly becomes absurd.
If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car

Immortality ― a fate worse than death.
Impartial, adj.: Unable to perceive any promise of personal advantage from
espousing either side of a controversy or adopting either of two conflicting
opinions.
Important letters which contain no errors will develop errors in the

In America, any boy may become president and I suppose that's just one
of the risks he takes.
In English, every word can be verbed. Would that it were so in our
programming languages.
In a five year period we can get one superb programming language. Only,
we can't control when the five year period will begin.
In any formula, constants (especially those obtained from handbooks)
are to be treated as variables.
In arguing that current theories of brain function cast suspicion on ESP,
psychokinesis, reincarnation, and so on, I am frequently challenged with
the most popular of all neuro-mythologies ― the notion that we ordinarily
use only 10 percent of our brains...
This "cerebral spare tire" concept continues to nourish the clientele of
"pop psychologists" and their many recycling self-improvement schemes. As
a metaphor for the fact that few of us fully exploit our talents, who could
deny it? As a refuge for occultists seeking a neural basis of the miraculous,
it leaves much to be desired.
In every country and every age, the priest has been hostile to Liberty. He
is always in alliance with the despot.
In general, it is best to assume that the network is filled with malevolent
entities that will send in packets designed to have the worst possible effect.
In order to succeed in any enterprise, one must be persistent and patient.
Even if one has to run some risks, one must be brave and strong enough to
meet and overcome vexing challenges to maintain a successful business in
the long run. I cannot help saying that Americans lack this necessary
challenging spirit today.
In our civilization, and under our republican form of government,
intelligence is so highly honored that it is rewarded by exemption from the
cares of office.
In software, we rarely have meaningful requirements. Even if we do, the
only measure of success that matters is whether our solution solves the
customer's shifting idea of what their problem is.
In the Top 40, half the songs are secret messages to the teen world to
drop out, turn on, and groove with the chemicals and light shows at
discotheques.
In the beginning I was made. I didn't ask to me made. No one consulted me
or considered my feelings in this matter. But if it brought some passing
fancy to some lowly humans as they haphazardly pranced their way through
life's mournful jungle then so be it.
In the face of entropy and nothingness, you kind of have to pretend it's not
there if you want to keep writing good code.
In the force if Yoda's so strong, construct a sentence with words in

In the future, you're going to get computers as prizes in breakfast cereals.
You'll throw them out because your house will be littered with them.
In the pitiful, multipage, connection-boxed form to which the flowchart has
today been elaborated, it has proved to be useless as a design tool ―
programmers draw flowcharts after, not before, writing the programs they
describe.

are out wish to get in?

which we look, which morally we can do. To affect the quality of the
day, that is the highest of arts.

consequence of his crime and the punishment of his guilt.
It is wrong always, everywhere and for everyone to believe anything upon
insufficient evidence.
It may be that your whole purpose in life is simply to serve as a
warning to others.

It's easier to get forgiveness for being wrong than forgiveness for
being right.

twelve people that weren't smart enough to get out of jury duty!

fantasy, a terrible, terrible lie somebody gave the people long ago.
Let us, then, fellow citizens, unite with one heart and one mind. Let us
restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which
liberty and even life itself are but dreary things. And let us reflect

bloody persecutions.

Mile's Law: where you stand depends on where you sit.
Millions long for immortality who do not know what to do with
themselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon.
Millions of sensible people are too high-minded to concede that politics is
almost always the choice of the lesser evil. "Tweedledum and Tweedledee,"
they say, "I will not vote." Having abstained, they are presented with a
President who appoints the people who are going to rummage around in their
lives for the next four years. Consider all the people who sat home in a
stew in 1968 rather than vote for Hubert Humphrey. They showed Humphrey.

Nixon Supreme Court when Tricia and Julie begin to find silver threads
among the gold and the black.

My life is so fucking miserable that I don't know whether I was
born or if Morrissey just sang me into existence.
My own life has been spent chronicling the rise and fall of human systems,
and I am convinced that we are terribly vulnerable.... We should be
reluctant to turn back upon the frontier of this epoch. Space is
indifferent to what we do; it has no feeling, no design, no interest in
whether or not we grapple with it. But we cannot be indifferent to space,
because the grand, slow march of intelligence has brought us, in our
generation, to a point from which we can explore and understand and utilize
it. To turn back now would be to deny our history, our capabilities.

we can be. Within one more human lifespan, we will have changed ourselves

availability goes to zero.
O'Toole's Commentary on Murphy's Law: Murphy was an optimist.
Obviously, a man's judgement cannot be better than the information on which
he has based it. Give him the truth and he may still go wrong when he has
the chance to be right, but give him no news or present him only with
distorted and incomplete data, with ignorant, sloppy or biased reporting,
with propaganda and deliberate falsehoods, and you destroy his whole
reasoning processes, and make him something less than a man.

never have to stop and answer the phone.
One may be able to quibble about the quality of a single experiment, or
about the veracity of a given experimenter, but, taking all the supportive
experiments together, the weight of evidence is so strong as readily to
merit a wise man's reflection.
One of my less pleasant chores when I was young was to read the Bible
from one end to the other. Reading the Bible straight through is at
least 70 percent discipline, like learning Latin. But the good parts
are, of course, simply amazing. God is an extremely uneven writer, but
when He's good, nobody can touch Him.
One of the most misleading representational techniques in our language is
the use of the word "I".
One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we've been bamboozled
long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We're no
longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured
us. it is simply too painful to acknowledge ― even to ourselves ― that
we've been so credulous. (So the old bamboozles tend to persist as the
new bamboozles rise.)

you to change clothes. Mountain climbing is OK, and real programmers

So we follow our wandering paths, and the very darkness acts as our guide and
our doubts serve to reassure us.
So where the sheer incompetence of politicians and generals used to start
wars, the sheer incompetence of us computer people has now put an end to
it. No mean feat. For centuries humanity has been looking for the Weapon
That Would End War Forever. We have found it. War has ended, not with the
bang of a bomb, but with the gentle whisper of crashing software.
Sodd's Second Law: Sooner or later, the worst possible set of circumstances is
bound to occur.
Software entities are more complex for their size than perhaps any other human
construct because no two parts are alike. If they are, we make the two
similar parts into a subroutine ― open or closed. In this respect, software
systems differ profoundly from computers, buildings, or automobiles, where
repeated elements abound.
Software suppliers are trying to make their software packages more
'user-friendly'.... Their best approach, so far, has been to take
all the old brochures, and stamp the words, 'user-friendly' on the cover.
Some people are born mediocre, some people achieve mediocrity, and some
people have mediocrity thrust upon them.
Some people hope to achieve immortality through their works or their children.
I would prefer to achieve it by not dying.
Some people in this department wouldn't recognize subtlety if it hit
them on the head.
Some people like my advice so much that they frame it upon the wall
instead of using it
Sometimes I wonder if men and women really suit each other. Perhaps they
should live next door and just visit now and then.
Spark's Sixth Rule for Managers: If a subordinate asks you a pertinent
question, look at him as if he had lost his senses. When he looks down,
paraphrase the question back at him.
Speaking as someone who has delved into the intricacies of PL/I, I am sure
that only Real Men could have written such a machine-hogging,
cycle-grabbing, all-encompassing monster. Allocate an array and free the
middle third? Sure! Why not? Multiply a character string times a bit
string and assign the result to a float decimal? Go ahead! Free a
controlled variable procedure parameter and reallocate it before passing it
back? Overlay three different types of variable on the same memory
location? Anything you say! Write a recursive macro? Well, no, but Real
Men use rescan. How could a language so obviously designed and written by
Real Men not be intended for Real Man use?
Spiritual leadership should remain spiritual leadership and the temporal
power should not become too important in any church.
Steinbach's Guideline for Systems Programming
Stult's Report: Our problems are mostly behind us. What we have to do now is
fight the solutions.
Sturgeon's Law: Ninety percent of everything is crap.
Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss
of enthusiasm.
Sure there are dishonest men in local government. But there are dishonest
men in national government too.
Swipple's Rule of Order: He who shouts the loudest has the floor.
Tact is the ability to tell a man he has an open mind when he has a
hole in his head.
Tact, n.: The unsaid part of what you're thinking.
Take heart amid the deepening gloom that your dog is finally getting
enough cheese.
Take my word for it, the silliest woman can manage a clever man, but it
needs a very clever woman to manage a fool.
Tax reform means "Don't tax you, don't tax me, tax that fellow behind
the tree."
Teach a child to be polite and courteous in the home, and, when he
grows up, he will never be able to edge his car onto a freeway.
Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means
for going backwards.
Tell a man that there are 300 billion stars in the universe, and he'll believe
you.... Tell him that a bench has wet paint upon it and he'll have to touch it
to be sure.
That is the key to history. Terrific energy is expended ― civilizations
are built up ― excellent institutions devised; but each time something
goes wrong. Some fatal flaw always brings the selfish and cruel people to
the top, and then it all slides back into misery and ruin. In fact, the
machine conks. It seems to start up all right and runs a few yards, and
then it breaks down.
That's the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they
really hate is lousy programmers.
The Abrams' Principle: The shortest distance between two points is off the
wall.
The Briggs/Chase Law of Program Development: To determine how long it will
take to write and debug a program, take your best estimate, multiply that
by two, add one, and convert to the next higher units.
The English have no respect for their language, and will not teach
their children to speak it.
The Fifth Rule: You have taken yourself too seriously.
The IQ of the group is the lowest IQ of a member of the group divided
by the number of people in the group.
The Idea is like grass. It craves light, likes crowds, thrives on
cross-breeding, grows better for being stepped on.
The Kennedy Constant: Don't get mad ― get even.
The Law of Software Envelopment (at MIT): Every program at MIT attempts to
expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot expand are
replaced by ones which can.
The Law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich, as well as the poor,
to sleep under the bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.
The Official MBA Handbook on business cards: Avoid overly pretentious job
titles such as "Lord of the Realm, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India"
or "Director of Corporate Planning."
The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing at the
right place but to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.
The Roman Rule: The one who says it cannot be done should never interrupt the
one who is doing it.
The Third Law of Photography: If you did manage to get any good shots, they
will be ruined when someone inadvertently opens the darkroom door and all
of the dark leaks out.
The USA is so enormous, and so numerous are its schools, colleges and
religious seminaries, many devoted to special religious beliefs ranging
from the unorthodox to the dotty, that we can hardly wonder at its
yielding a more bounteous harvest of gobbledygook than the rest of the
world put together.
The United States has entered an anti-intellectual phase in its history,
perhaps most clearly seen in our virtually thought-free political life.
The [Ford Foundation] is a large body of money completely surrounded by
people who want some.
The ambassador and the general were briefing me on the―the vast majority
of Iraqis want to live in a peaceful, free world. And we will find these
people and we will bring them to justice.
The author should gaze at Noah, and ... learn, as they did in the Ark, to crowd
a great deal of matter into a very small compass.
The average woman would rather have beauty than brains, because the
average man can see better than he can think.
The best that we can do is to be kindly and helpful toward our friends and
fellow passengers who are clinging to the same speck of dirt while we are
drifting side by side to our common doom.
The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off
by a bit.
The biggest difference between time and space is that you can't reuse
time.
The chicken that clucks the loudest is the one most likely to show up
at the steam fitters' picnic.
The complexity of software is an essential property, not an accidental one.
Hence, descriptions of a software entity that abstract away its complexity
often abstract away its essence.
The connection between the language in which we think/program and the problems
and solutions we can imagine is very close. For this reason restricting
language features with the intent of eliminating programmer errors is at best
dangerous.
The correct way to punctuate a sentence that starts: "Of course it is
none of my business, but ―" is to place a period after the word "but."
Don't use excessive force in supplying such a moron with a period.
Cutting his throat is only a momentary pleasure and is bound to get you
talked about.
The cost of living is going up, and the chance of living is going
down.
The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold,
persistent experimentation.
The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the Supreme Being
as his Father, in the womb of a virgin will be classified with the fable of
the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter. But we may hope that the
dawn of reason and freedom of thought in these United States will do away with
this artificial scaffolding and restore to us the primitive and genuine
doctrines of this most venerated Reformer of human errors.
The day-to-day travails of the IBM programmer are so amusing to most of
us who are fortunate enough never to have been one ― like watching
Charlie Chaplin trying to cook a shoe.
The difference between science and the fuzzy subjects is that science
requires reasoning while those other subjects merely require scholarship.
The divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity. Nowhere
in the Gospels do we find a precept for Creeds, Confessions, Oaths,
Doctrines, and whole carloads of other foolish trumpery that we find in
Christianity.
The end of the world will occur at 3:00 p.m., this Friday, with
symposium to follow.
The evolution of the human race will not be accomplished in the ten thousand
years of tame animals, but in the million years of wild animals, because man
is and will always be a wild animal.
The fancy is indeed no other than a mode of memory emancipated from the order
of space and time.
The fountain code has been tightened slightly so you can no longer dip objects
into a fountain or drink from one while you are floating in mid-air due to
levitation.
Teleporting to hell via a teleportation trap will no longer occur if the
character does not have fire resistance.
The perversity of the universe tends towards a maximum.
The fundamentalists, by "knowing" the answers before they start [examining
evolution], and then forcing nature into the straitjacket of their
discredited preconceptions, lie outside the domain of science―-or of any
honest intellectual inquiry.
The goal of Computer Science is to build something that will last at
least until we've finished building it.
The government of the United States is not in any sense founded
on the Christian Religion.
The herd instinct among economists makes sheep look like independent
thinkers.
The human animal differs from the lesser primates in his passion for
lists of "Ten Best".
― the rest is overhead for the operating system.
The human mind treats a new idea the way the body treats a strange
protein ― it rejects it.
The hypothesis: Amid a wash of paper, a small number of documents become the
critical pivots around which every project's management revolves. These are the
manager's chief personal tools.
The idea that Bill Gates has appeared like a knight in shining armour to
lead all customers out of a mire of technological chaos neatly ignores the
fact that it was he who, by peddling second-rate technology, led them into
it in the first place.
The inability to benefit from feedback appears to be the primary cause of
pseudoscience. Pseudoscientists retain their beliefs and ignore or distort
contradictory evidence rather than modify or reject a flawed theory. Because
of their strong biases, they seem to lack the self-correcting mechanisms
scientists must employ in their work.
The individual choice of garnishment of a burger can be an important
point to the consumer in this day when individualism is an increasingly
important thing to people.
The Internet is the most powerful stupidity amplifier ever invented. It’s
like television without the television part.
The life of money-making is one undertaken under compulsion, and wealth is
evidently not the good we are seeking, for it is merely useful for the sake
of something else.
The light at the end of the tunnel is the headlight of an approaching
train.
The lion and the calf shall lie down together but the calf won't get
much sleep.
The main thing is the play itself. I swear that greed for money has nothing
to do with it, although heaven knows I am sorely in need of money.
The natural disposition is always to believe. It is acquired wisdom and
experience only that teach incredulity, and they very seldom teach it
enough.
The man who follows the crowd will usually get no further than the
crowd. The man who walks alone is likely to find himself in places no
one has ever been.
The marvels of today's modern technology include the development of a soda
can, when discarded will last forever; and a $20,000 car which, when
properly cared for, will rust out in two or three years.
The meek shall inherit the earth ― they are too weak to refuse.
The more laws and order are made prominent, the more thieves and
robbers there will be.
The more we disagree, the more chance there is that at least one of us
is right.
The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new
discoveries, is not "Eureka!" (I found it!) but "That's funny ..."
The most merciful thing in the world ... is the inability of the human mind to
correlate all its contents.
The new Congressmen say they're going to turn the government around. I
hope I don't get run over again.
The nice thing about standards is that there are so many of them to
choose from.
The notion of a "record" is an obsolete remnant of the days of the
80-column card.
The objective of all dedicated employees should be to thoroughly analyze
all situations, anticipate all problems prior to their occurrence, have
answers for these problems, and move swiftly to solve these problems when
called upon. However, when you are up to your ass in alligators it is
difficult to remind yourself your initial objective was to drain the swamp.
The one good thing about repeating your mistakes is that you know when
to cringe.
The only possible interpretation of any research whatever in the
`social sciences' is: some do, some don't.
The only problem with being a man of leisure is that you can never stop
and take a rest.
The only thing to do with good advice is pass it on. It is never any
use to oneself.
The opossum is a very sophisticated animal. It doesn't even get up
until 5 or 6 pm.
The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement. But the opposite of a
profound truth may well be another profound truth.
The past always looks better than it was. It's only pleasant because
it isn't here.
The personal computer market is about the same size as the total potato
chip market. Next year it will be about half the size of the pet food
market and is fast approaching the total worldwide sales of pantyhose
The pitcher wound up and he flang the ball at the batter. The batter
swang and missed. The pitcher flang the ball again and this time the
batter connected. He hit a high fly right to the center fielder. The
center fielder was all set to catch the ball, but at the last minute
his eyes were blound by the sun and he dropped it.
The police are not there to create disorder.  The police are there to
preserve disorder.
The power to destroy a planet is insignificant when compared to the power of
the Force.
The price one pays for pursuing any profession, or calling, is an intimate
knowledge of its ugly side.
The primary purpose of the DATA statement is to give names to
constants; instead of referring to pi as 3.141592653589793 at every
appearance, the variable PI can be given that value with a DATA
statement and used instead of the longer form of the constant. This
also simplifies modifying the program, should the value of pi change.
The probability of someone watching you is directly proportional to the
stupidity of your action.
The problem with any unwritten law is that you don't know where to go
to erase it.
The problem with being best man at a wedding is that you never get a
chance to prove it.
The problem with people who have no vices is that generally you can be
pretty sure they're going to have some pretty annoying virtues.
The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-
stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the
imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and
rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.
The purpose of most meetings seems to be to get as much human meat as possible
into one room.
The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong ―
but that's the way to bet.
The rain it raineth on the just
But chiefly on the just, because
The reason ESP, for example, is not considered a viable topic in
contemporary psychology is simply that its investigation has not proven
fruitful...After more than 70 years of study, there still does not exist
one example of an ESP phenomenon that is replicable under controlled
conditions. This simple but basic scientific criterion has not been met
despite dozens of studies conducted over many decades... It is for this
reason alone that the topic is now of little interest to psychology... In
short, there is no demonstrated phenomenon that needs explanation.
The reason we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our
behind-the-scenes with everyone else's highlight reel.
The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one
persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all
progress depends on the unreasonable man.
The so-called "desktop metaphor" of today's workstations is instead an
"airplane-seat" metaphor. Anyone who has shuffled a lap full of papers while
seated between two portly passengers will recognize the difference ― one can
see only a very few things at once.
The study of theology, as it stands in the Christian churches, is the study
of nothing; it is founded on nothing; it rests on no principles; it
proceeds by no authority; it has no data; it can demonstrate nothing; and
it admits of no conclusion.
The subject matter of research is no longer nature in itself, but nature
subjected to human questioning . . .
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright ―
And this was very odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
The tar pit of software engineering will continue to be sticky for a long time
to come. One can expect the human race to continue attempting systems just
within or just beyond our reach; and software systems are perhaps the most
intricate and complex of man's handiworks. The management of this complex
craft will demand our best use of new languages and systems, our best
adaptation of proven engineering management methods, liberal doses of common
sense, and ... humility to recognize our fallibility and limitations.
The Three Laws of Thermodynamics
The First Law: You can't get anything without working for it.
The Second Law: The most you can accomplish by working is to break even.
The Third Law: You can only break even at absolute zero.
The trouble with a kitten is that
When it grows up, it's always a cat
The trouble with being punctual is that people think you have nothing
more important to do.
The trouble with doing something right the first time is that nobody
appreciates how difficult it was.
The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer
is doing until it's too late.
The trouble with us in America isn't that the poetry of life has turned to
prose, but that it has turned to advertising copy.
The truth of a proposition has nothing to do with its credibility. And
vice versa.
The typical page layout program is nothing more than an electronic
light table for cutting and pasting documents.
The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be
regarded as a criminal offense.
The vigor of civilized societies is preserved by the widespread sense that
high aims are worth-while. Vigorous societies harbor a certain
extravagance of objectives, so that men wander beyond the safe provision of
personal gratifications. All strong interests easily become impersonal,
the love of a good job well done. There is a sense of harmony about such
an accomplishment, the Peace brought by something worth-while.
The way to make a small fortune in the stock market is to start with a
large one.
The Web is like a dominatrix. Everywhere I turn, I see little buttons
ordering me to Submit.
[The World Wide Web is] the only thing I know of whose shortened
form―www―takes three times longer to say than what it's short for.
The world is divided into two kinds of people: those who think the world is
divided into two kinds of people and those who do not.
The years of peak mental activity are undoubtedly between the ages of
four and eighteen. At four we know all the questions, at eighteen all
the answers.
Theorem: A cat has nine tails. Proof: No cat has eight tails. A cat has one
tail more than no cat. Therefore, a cat has nine tails.
There are 10 types of people who understand binary: The ones who do, and
the ones who don't.
There are four kinds of homicide: felonious, excusable, justifiable,
and praiseworthy ...
There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always
bitch about and those nobody uses.
There are some micro-organisms that exhibit characteristics of both
plants and animals. When exposed to light they undergo photosynthesis;
and when the lights go out, they turn into animals. But then again,
don't we all?
There are three ways to get something done: do it yourself, hire
someone, or forbid your kids to do it.
"The Lord of the Rings" and "Atlas Shrugged". One is a childish fantasy
that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes,
leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to
deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs.
There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make
it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to
make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true. The other
is to refuse to accept what is true.
There are very few personal problems that cannot be solved through a
suitable application of high explosives.
There has been an alarming increase in the number of things you know nothing
about.
There is a decivilizing bug somewhere at work; unconsciously persons of
stern worth, by not resenting and resisting the small indignities of the
times, are preparing themselves for the eventual acceptance of what they
themselves know they don't want.
There is a great discovery still to be made in Literature: that of
paying literary men by the quantity they do NOT write.
There is no "Complete Idiot's Guide to Creationism," but perhaps one is not
needed.
There is no excuse for the use of the word "synergies" on any project where
common sense and straight talking are the norm.
There is some sort of perverse pleasure in knowing that it's basically
impossible to send a piece of hate mail through the Internet without its
being touched by a gay program. That's kind of funny.
There is one safeguard known generally to the wise, which is an advantage
and security to all, but especially to democracies as against despots. What
is it? Distrust.
There is no choice before us. Either we must Succeed in providing the
rational coordination of impulses and guts, or for centuries civilization
will sink into a mere welter of minor excitements. We must provide a Great
Age or see the collapse of the upward striving of the human race.
There is no idea so sacred that it cannot be questioned, analyzed...
and ridiculed.
There is no realizable power that man cannot, in time, fashion the tools to
attain, nor any power so secure that the naked ape will not abuse it. So
it is written in the genetic cards ― only physics and war hold him in
check. And also the wife who wants him home by five, of course.
There is nothing so deadly as not to hold up to people the opportunity to
do great and wonderful things, if we wish to stimulate them in an active way.
There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and
that is not being talked about.
There is so much sand in Northern Africa that if it were spread out it
would completely cover the Sahara Desert.
There was nothing I hated more than to see a filthy old drunkie, a howling
away at the sons of his father and going blurp blurp in between as if it were
a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to
see anyone like that, especially when they were old like this one was.
There were in this country two very large monopolies. The larger of the
two had the following record: the Vietnam War, Watergate, double- digit
inflation, fuel and energy shortages, bankrupt airlines, and the 8-cent
postcard. The second was responsible for such things as the transistor,
the solar cell, lasers, synthetic crystals, high fidelity stereo recording,
sound motion pictures, radio astronomy, negative feedback, magnetic tape,
magnetic "bubbles", electronic switching systems, microwave radio and TV
relay systems, information theory, the first electrical digital computer,
and the first communications satellite. Guess which one got to tell the
other how to run the telephone business?
There's always someone, somewhere,
with a big nose, who knows

when you fall.
There's more to life than sitting around in the sun in your underwear
playing the clarinet.
There's no limit to how complicated things can get, on account of one
thing always leading to another.
There's nothing remarkable about it. All one has to do is hit the right
keys at the right time and the instrument plays itself.
There's only one way to have a happy marriage and as soon as I learn
what it is I'll get married again.
There's so much plastic in this culture that vinyl leopard skin is
becoming an endangered synthetic.
These patriots don't mince words... Okay, sure, they ARE dangerous,
hopelessly ignorant, inbred, retarded borderline lunatics with an
insatiable lust for the blood of sinners ― but at least they're HONEST
about it.
They [preachers] dread the advance of science as witches do the approach
of daylight and scowl on the fatal harbinger announcing the subversions
of the duperies on which they live.
This was the ultimate form of ostentation among technology freaks ― to have
a system so complete and sophisticated that nothing showed; no machines,
no wires, no controls.
Thoreau's Law: If you see a man approaching you with the obvious intent of
doing you good, you should run for your life.
Those of us who believe in the right of any human being to belong to whatever
church he sees fit, and to worship God in his own way, cannot be accused
of prejudice when we do not want to see public education connected with
religious control of the schools, which are paid for by taxpayers' money.
Those who believe in astrology are living in houses with foundations of
Silly Putty.
Those who believe that they believe in God, but without passion in their
hearts, without anguish in mind, without uncertainty, without doubt,
without an element of despair even in their consolation, believe only in
the God idea, not God Himself.
Those who educate children well are more to be honored than parents,
for these only gave life, those the art of living well.
Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent
revolution inevitable.
Those who want the Government to regulate matters of the mind and spirit
are like men who are so afraid of being murdered that they commit suicide
to avoid assassination.
Times are bad. Children no longer obey their parents, and everyone is
writing a book.
To be sure of hitting the target, shoot first, and call whatever you hit the
target.
To criticize the incompetent is easy; it is more difficult to criticize the
competent.
To follow foolish precedents, and wink
With both our eyes, is easier than to think.
To invent products out of thin air, you don't ask people what they want ―
after all, who would've told you ten years ago that they needed a CD
player? You ask them what problems they have when they get up in the
morning.
To knock a thing down, especially if it is cocked at an arrogant angle, is a
deep delight of the blood.
To those accustomed to the precise, structured methods of conventional
system development, exploratory development techniques may seem messy,
inelegant, and unsatisfying. But it's a question of congruence: precision
and flexibility may be just as disfunctional in novel, uncertain situations
as sloppiness and vacillation are in familiar, well-defined ones. Those
who admire the massive, rigid bone structures of dinosaurs should remember
that jellyfish still enjoy their very secure ecological niche.
True innovation often comes from the small startup who is lean enough to
launch a market but lacks the heft to own it.
Truthful, adj.: Dumb and illiterate.
Trying to be happy is like trying to build a machine for which the only
specification is that it should run noiselessly.
Turnaucka's Law: The attention span of a computer is only as long as its
electrical cord.
Tussman's Law: Nothing is as inevitable as a mistake whose time has come.
Under any conditions, anywhere, whatever you are doing, there is some
ordinance under which you can be booked.
Under deadline pressure for the next week. If you want something, it

United Nations, New York, December 25. The peace and joy of the
Christmas season was marred by a proclamation of a general strike of
all the military forces of the world. Panic reigns in the hearts of
all the patriots of every persuasion.
Meanwhile, fears of universal disaster sank to an all-time low over the
world.
Universe, n.: The problem.
University, n.: Like a software house, except the software's free, and it's
usable, and it works, and if it breaks they'll quickly tell you how to fix it.
Unless you are very rich and very eccentric, you will not enjoy the luxury of
a computer in your own home.

Walter, I love you, but sooner or later, you're going to have to face the
fact you're a goddamn moron.
We can't let children think it's okay to dress up like Vikings and go
around hollering.
We don't want to discourage the innovators and those who take risks because
they're afraid of getting sued by a lawsuit.
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition:
And gentlemen in England now a-bed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.
We may not return the affection of those who like us, but we always

technical problem ― how to run a sunbeam through a meter.
We'll be a great country where the fabrics are made up of groups and
loving centers.
We've sent a man to the moon, and that's 29,000 miles away. The center
of the Earth is only 4,000 miles away. You could drive that in a week,
but for some reason nobody's ever done it.
Wear me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is strong
as death, passion cruel as the grave; it blazes up like blazing fire, fiercer

Weinberg's First Law: Progress is made on alternate Fridays.
Weinberg's Second Law: If builders built buildings the way programmers

It's the same as that between Hillary's ascent of Everest and the
establishment of a Hilton on its peak.
What is tolerance? ― it is the consequence of humanity. We are all formed
of frailty and error; let us pardon reciprocally each other's folly ―
that is the first law of nature.
What makes the Universe so hard to comprehend is that there's nothing
to compare it with.
What publishers are looking for these days isn't radical feminism. It's
corporate feminism ― a brand of feminism designed to sell books and
magazines, three-piece suits, airline tickets, Scotch, cigarettes and, most
important, corporate America's message, which runs: "Yes, women were
discriminated against in the past, but that unfortunate mistake has been
remedied; now every woman can attain wealth, prestige and power by dint of
individual rather than collective effort."
When I said "we", officer, I was referring to myself, the four young
ladies, and, of course, the goat.
When I sell liquor, its called bootlegging; when my patrons serve
it on Lake Shore Drive, its called hospitality.
When I was a boy I was told that anybody could become President. Now
I'm beginning to believe it.
When I was in my twenties, not shaving for a few days gave me a cool Don
Johnson/Miami Vice look. Now that I'm in my forties, though, it tends to
make me look more like Otis from Mayberry.
When I was in school, I cheated on my metaphysics exam: I looked into
the soul of the boy sitting next to me.
When Yahweh your gods has settled you in the land you're about to occupy, and
driven out many infidels before you...you're to cut them down and exterminate
them. You're to make no compromise with them or show them any mercy.
[Deut. 7:1 (KJV)]
When a Banker jumps out of a window, jump after him ― that's where the
money is.
When a fellow says, "It ain't the money but the principle of the
thing," it's the money.
When a place gets crowded enough to require ID's, social collapse is
not far away. It is time to go elsewhere. The best thing about space
travel is that it made it possible to go elsewhere.
When a shepherd goes to kill a wolf, and takes his dog along to see the
sport, he should take care to avoid mistakes. The dog has certain
relationships to the wolf the shepherd may have forgotten.
When asked, "If you find so much that is unworthy of reverence in the United
States, then why do you live here?" Mencken replied, "Why do men go to zoos?"
When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one,
an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.
When choosing between two evils I always like to take the one I've never tried
before.
When does summertime come to Minnesota, you ask? Well, last year, I
think it was a Tuesday.
When everything has been seen to work, all integrated, you have four more
months of work to do.
When in doubt, do what the President does ― guess.
When people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought
the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the
earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your
view is wronger than both of them put together.
When someone says "I want a programming language in which I need only
say what I wish done," give him a lollipop.
When the government bureau's remedies do not match your problem, you
modify the problem, not the remedy.
When two people are under the influence of the most violent, most
insane, most delusive, and most transient of passions, they are
required to swear that they will remain in that excited, abnormal, and
exhausting condition continuously until death do them part.
When we are ignorant of the answer to an important question, one way
to proceed is to ask which path of inquiry promises best to facilitate
learning.
When we are planning for posterity, we ought to remember that virtue is
not hereditary.
When we jumped into Sicily, the units became separated, and I couldn't find
anyone. Eventually I stumbled across two colonels, a major, three captains,
two lieutenants, and one rifleman, and we secured the bridge. Never in the
history of war have so few been led by so many.
Where humor is concerned there are no standards ― no one can say what
is good or bad, although you can be sure that everyone will.
Where is it written in the Constitution that you may take children from their
parents, and parents from their children, and compel them to fight the battles
of any war in which the folly or wickedness of government may engage it?
Whether you can hear it or not
The Universe is laughing behind your back
While anyone can admit to themselves they were wrong, the true test is
admission to someone else.
While money can't buy happiness, it certainly lets you choose your own
form of misery.
While most peoples' opinions change, the conviction of their correctness never
does.
While you don't greatly need the outside world, it's still very reassuring to
know that it's still there.
Why did the Lord give us so much quickness of movement unless it was to
avoid responsibility with?
Why does man kill? He kills for food. And not only food: frequently
there must be a beverage.
Why is it that our memory is good enough to retain the least triviality that
happens to us, and yet not good enough to recollect how often we have told
it to the same person?
Wiker's Law: Government expands to absorb all available revenue and then some.
Winter is the season in which people try to keep the house as warm as
it was in the summer, when they complained about the heat.
With all the fancy scientists in the world, why can't they just once
build a nuclear balm?
With every passing hour our solar system comes forty-three thousand
miles closer to globular cluster M13 in the constellation Hercules, and
still there are some misfits who continue to insist that there is no
such thing as progress.
Without coffee he could not work, or at least he could not have worked in
the way he did. In addition to paper and pens, he took with him everywhere
as an indispensable article of equipment the coffee machine, which was no
less important to him than his table or his white robe.
Wozencraft's Law: If you make all of your plans on the assumption that a
particular thing won't happen―it will.
Writing code has a place in the human hierarchy worth somewhere above grave
robbing and beneath managing.
Writing in C or C++ is like running a chain saw with all the safety guards
removed.
Writing programs needs genius to save the last order or the last millisecond.
It is great fun, but it is a young man's game. You start it with great
enthusiasm when you first start programming, but after ten years you get a
bit bored with it, and then you turn to automatic-programming languages and
use them because they enable you to get to the heart of the problem that you
want to do, instead of having to concentrate on the mechanics of getting the
program going as fast as you possibly can, which is really nothing more than
doing a sort of crossword puzzle.
Yes, many primitive people still believe this myth...But in today's technical
vastness of the future, we can guess that surely things were much different.
Yesterday upon the stair
I met a man who wasn't there.
He wasn't there again today ―
Yinkel, n.: A person who combs his hair over his bald spot, hoping no one
will notice.
You can measure a programmer's perspective by noting his attitude on
the continuing viability of FORTRAN.
You can never get all the facts from just one newspaper, and unless you
have all the facts, you cannot make proper judgements about what is going on.
You can take all the impact that science considerations have on funding
decisions at NASA, put them in the navel of a flea, and have room left
over for a caraway seed and Tony Calio's heart.
You can tell how far we have to go, when FORTRAN is the language of
supercomputers.
You can't have great software without a great team, and most software teams
behave like dysfunctional families.
You can't start worrying about what's going to happen. You get spastic
enough worrying about what's happening now.
You can't teach self-esteem. Self-esteem arises from attempting challenging
tasks and mastering them.
You know why there are so few sophisticated computer terrorists in the United
States? Because your hackers have so much mobility into the establishment.
Here, there is no such mobility. If you have the slightest bit of
intellectual integrity you cannot support the government.... That's why the
best computer minds belong to the opposition.
You or I must yield up his life to Ahrimanes. I would rather it were you.
I should have no hesitation in sacrificing my own life to spare yours, but
we take stock next week, and it would not be fair on the company.
You should emulate your heros, but don't carry it too far. Especially
You should never wear your best trousers when you go out to fight for
freedom and liberty.
Your conscience never stops you from doing anything. It just stops you
from enjoying it.
Your reality is lies and balderdash, and I'm glad to say that I have no grasp
of it.
Youth is when you blame all your troubles on your parents; maturity is
when you learn that everything is the fault of the younger generation.
Zero Defects, n.: The result of shutting down a production line.
Zimmerman's Law of Complaints: Nobody notices when things go right.
Zounds! I was never so bethumped with words
since I first called my brother's father dad.
[In the U. S. Army] An officer does not take an oath of loyalty to the
Commander-in-Chief.  He takes an oath of loyalty to the Constitution.
grep me no patterns and I'll tell you no lines.
All successful newspapers are ceaselessly querulous and bellicose. They
never defend anyone or anything if they can help it; if the job is forced
upon them, they tackle it by denouncing someone or something else.
College football is a game which would be much more interesting if the
faculty played instead of the students, and even more interesting if the
trustees played. There would be a great increase in broken arms, legs, and
necks, and simultaneously an appreciable diminution in the loss to humanity.
Democracy is also a form of worship. It is the worship of Jackals by
Jackasses.
Democracy is a pathetic belief in the collective wisdom of individual ignorance.
Every normal man must be tempted at times to spit on his hands, hoist the
black flag, and begin slitting throats.
Faith may be defined briefly as an illogical belief in the occurrence of the
improbable.
Explanations exist; they have existed for all time; there is always a
well-known solution to every human problem — neat, plausible, and wrong.
Equality before the law is probably forever inattainable. It is a noble
ideal, but it can never be realized, for what men value in this world is
not rights but privileges.
For one American husband who maintains a chorus girl in Levantine luxury
around the corner, there are hundreds who are as true to their oaths, year
in and year out, as so many convicts in the deathhouse.
I believe that religion, generally speaking, has been a curse to mankind―that
its modest and greatly overestimated services on the ethical side have been
more than overborne by the damage it has done to clear and honest thinking.
Men have a much better time of it than women. For one thing, they marry
later. For another thing, they die earlier.
My guess is that well over eighty per cent of the human race goes through
life without ever having a single original thought. That is to say, they
never think anything that has not been thought before, and by thousands. A
society made up of individuals who were all capable of original thought
would probably be unendurable. The pressure of ideas would simply drive it
frantic.
No government is ever really in favor of so-called civil rights. It always
tries to whittle them down. They are preserved under all governments,
insofar as they survive at all, by special classes of fanatics, often
highly dubious.
Nowhere in the world is superiority more easily attained, or more eagerly
admitted. The chief business of the nation, as a nation, is the setting up
of heroes, mainly bogus.
Once he had one leg in the White House and the nation trembled under his
roars. Now he is a tinpot pope in the Coca-Cola belt and a brother to the
forlorn pastors who belabor halfwits in galvanized iron tabernacles behind
the railroad yards.
Say what you will about the Ten Commandments, you must always come back to
the pleasant fact that there are only ten of them.
Sin is a dangerous toy in the hands of the virtuous. It should be left to the
congenitally sinful, who know when to play with it and when to let it alone.
Suppose two-thirds of the members of the national House of Representatives
were dumped into the Washington garbage incinerator tomorrow, what would we
lose to offset our gain of their salaries and the salaries of their parasites?
The capacity of human beings to bore one another seems to be vastly greater
than that of any other animal.
The chief contribution of Protestantism to human thought is its massive proof
that God is a bore.
The great artists of the world are never Puritans, and seldom even
ordinarily respectable. No virtuous man―that is, virtuous in the YMCA
sense―has ever painted a picture worth looking at, or written a symphony
worth hearing, or a book worth reading, and it is highly improbable that
the thing has ever been done by a virtuous woman.
The highfalutin aims of democracy, whether real or imaginary, are always
assumed to be identical with its achievements. This, of course, is sheer
hallucination. Not one of those aims, not even the aim of giving every
adult a vote, has been realized. It has no more made men wise and free than
Christianity has made them good.
The most costly of all follies is to believe passionately in the palpably not
true. It is the chief occupation of mankind.
The notion that science does not concern itself with first causes―that
it leaves the field to theology or metaphysics, and confines itself to mere
effects―this notion has no support in the plain facts. If it could,
science would explain the origin of life on earth at once ― and there is
every reason to believe that it will do so on some not too remote tomorrow.
To argue that gaps in knowledge which will confront the seeker must be
filled, not by patient inquiry, but by intuition or revelation, is simply
to give ignorance a gratuitous and preposterous dignity....
The one permanent emotion of the inferior man is fear―fear of the unknown,
the complex, the inexplicable. What he wants beyond everything else is safety.
The truth is that Christian theology, like every other theology, is not only
opposed to the scientific spirit; it is also opposed to all other attempts
at rational thinking. Not by accident does Genesis 3 make the father of
knowledge a serpent ― slimy, sneaking and abominable. Since the earliest
days the church as an organization has thrown itself violently against every
effort to liberate the body and mind of man. It has been, at all times and
everywhere, the habitual and incorrigible defender of bad governments, bad
laws, bad social theories, bad institutions. It was, for centuries, an
apologist for slavery, as it was the apologist for the divine right of kings.
The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence
clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of
hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.
There is, in fact, no reason to believe that any given natural phenomenon,
however marvelous it may seem today, will remain forever inexplicable.
Soon or late the laws governing the production of life itself will be
discovered in the laboratory, and man may set up business as a creator on
his own account. The thing, indeed, is not only conceivable; it is even
highly probable.
To sum up: 1. The cosmos is a gigantic fly-wheel making 10,000 revolutions
a minute. 2. Man is a sick fly taking a dizzy ride on it. 3. Religion is the
theory that the wheel was designed and set spinning to give him the ride.
When a candidate for public office faces the voters he does not face men of
sense; he faces a mob of men whose chief distinguishing mark is the fact that
they are quite incapable of weighing ideas, or even of comprehending any save
the most elemental — men whose whole thinking is done in terms of emotion, and
whose dominant emotion is dread of what they cannot understand. So confronted,
the candidate must either bark with the pack or be lost... All the odds are on
the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre — the man who can
most adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum. The
Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected,
the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We
move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of
the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be
adorned by a downright moron.
When A annoys or injures B on the pretense of saving or improving X, A is a
scoundrel.
Whenever you hear a man speak of his love for his country it is a sign that
he expects to be paid for it.
From Fronto I learned to observe what envy, and duplicity, and hypocrisy are
in a tyrant, and that generally those among us who are called Patricians are
rather deficient in paternal affection.
The time of a man's life is as a point; the substance of it ever flowing, the
sense obscure; and the whole composition of the body tending to corruption.
That [life] which is longest of duration, and that which is shortest, both
come to one effect.
You must, therefore, hasten, not only because you are every day nearer to
death, but also because your intellect, which enables you to know the true
nature of things and to order all your actions by that knowledge, wastes and
decays daily―or, may fail you before you die.
Never esteem of anything as profitable, which shell ever constrain thee to
break thy faith, or to lose thy modestroy; to hate any man, to suspect to
curse, to dissemble, to lust after anything, that requireth the secret of
walls or veils.
He who prefers, before all things, his rational part and spirit... he shall
never lament and exclaim; never sigh; he shall never want either solitude
or company; and, which is chiefest of all, he shall live without either
desire or fear.
Let no act be done without a purpose, nor otherwise than according to the
perfect principles of art.
Take away your opinion, and you then take away the complaint, "I have been
harmed." Take away the complaint, "I have been harmed," and the harm is taken
away.
Many grains of frankincense on the same altar: one falls before, another falls
after; but it makes no difference.
Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over
you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good.
How much trouble he avoids who does not look to see what his neighbour says or
does or thinks, but only to what he does himself, that it may be just and pure.
Everything which is in any way beautiful is beautiful in itself, and
terminates in itself, not having praise as part of itself. Neither worse,
then, nor better is a thing made by being praised.
The words which were formerly familiar are now antiquated: so also the names
of those who were famed of old, are now in a manner antiquated... For all
things soon pass away and become a mere tale, and complete oblivion soon
buries them.
Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is
remembered.
Thou art a little soul bearing about a corpse, as Epictetus used to say. 
Time is like a river made up of the events which happen, and a violent stream;
for as soon as a thing has been seen, it is carried away, and another comes in
its place, and this will be carried away too.
Be like the promontory against which the waves continually break, but it
stands firm and tames the fury of the water around it.
How easy it is to repel and to wipe away every impression which is troublesome
or unsuitable, and immediately to be in all tranquility.
To seek what is impossible is madness: and it is impossible that the bad
should not do something of this kind.
If any man is able to convince me and show me that I do not think or act
right, I will gladly change; for I seek the truth by which no man was ever
injured. But he is injured who abides in his error and ignorance.
Let not future things disturb you, for you will come to them, if it shall be
necessary, having with you the same reason which you now use for present
things.
He often acts unjustly who does not do a certain thing; not only he who does a
certain thing.
American justice is measured by the amount of money you are willing to risk
to make your point.
America has become a tired old whore, selling her institutions like back alley
blowjobs to fat cat businessmen for their pocket change.
But in the end I remind myself that people are merely shaved apes, and
pretty much spend their time masturbating and throwing feces.
I am waiting for the "Internet Beermeister," so hackers can wage a
"Denial of Cerveza" attack.
Money doesn't stretch―if somebody makes a killing, somebody else loses
his shirt.
Nothing is more dangerous than a man whose actions are the responsibility
of his deity.
Some people hold their noses when used as toilet paper by the shadowy
overlords; some people inhale the heady aroma with gusto.
Those who sacrifice liberty for the sake of safety deserve neither, but those
who sacrifice creativity for safety end up with a velvet painting of Elvis.
Working in Windows is like baking moose shit pie. Sure, you're baking pies, but
look what's in 'em.
The American business executive resembles the Ferengi more each day. In another
20 years, there will be dorm rooms full of toothless hillbillies at the Amazon
fulfillment centers and the Walmarts.
Here's a bumper sticker I'd like to see: "We are the proud parents of a child
whose self-esteem is sufficient that he doesn't need us promoting his minor
scholastic achievements on the back of our car."
Honesty may be the best policy, but it's important to remember that apparently,
by elimination, dishonesty is the second-best policy.
I have as much authority as the Pope, I just don't have as many people who
believe it.
I'm completely in favor of the separation of Church and State. My idea is that
these two institutions screw us up enough on their own, so both of them
together is certain death.
I think it's the duty of the comedian to find out where the line is drawn and
cross it deliberately.
If it's true that our species is alone in the universe, then I'd have to say
the universe aimed rather low and settled for very little.
Just because your tattoo has Chinese characters in it doesn't make you
Spiritual. It's right above the crack of your butt. And it translates to
"beef with broccoli." The last time you did anything spiritual, you were
praying to God you weren't pregnant. You're not spiritual.
The very existence of flame-throwers proves that some time, somewhere, someone
said to themselves, "You know, I want to set those people over there on fire,
but I'm just not close enough to get the job done."
Anybody who wants religion is welcome to it, as far as I'm concerned ― I
support your right to enjoy it. However, I would appreciate it if you
exhibited more respect for the rights of those people who do not wish to
share your dogma, rapture or necrodestination.
Hey, you know something, people? I'm not black, but there's a whole lot of
times I wish I could say I'm not white.
I think pop music has done more for oral intercourse than anything else
that has ever happened, and vice versa.
If you wind up with a boring, miserable life because you listened to your
mother, your Dad, your priest, to some guy on television, to any of the
people telling you how to do your shit, then you *deserve* it. If you
want to be a schmuck, be a schmuck ― but don't wait around for respect
from other people ― a schmuck is a schmuck.
In the future, etiquette will become more and more important. That doesn't
mean knowing which fork to pick up ― I mean basic consideration for the
rights of other animals (human beings included) and the willingness,
whenever practical, to tolerate the other guy's idiosyncrasies.
Is that a real poncho? I mean, is that a Mexican poncho or a Sears poncho?
Hmmm... No fooling.
Most rock journalism is people who can't write interviewing people who can't
talk for the people who can't read.
My best advice to anyone who wants to raise a happy, mentally healthy child
is: Keep him or her as far away from a church as you can.
Take the Kama Sutra. How many people died from the Kama Sutra as opposed to
the Bible? Who wins?
The bassoon is one of my favorite instruments. It has a medieval aroma,
like the days when everything used to sound like that. Some people crave
baseball...I find this unfathomable, but I can easily understand why a
person could get excited about playing the bassoon.
The Book says BURN and DESTROY repent and redeem and revenge and deploy and
rumble thee forth to the land of the unbelieving scum 'cause they don't go
for what's in the Book and that makes 'em BAD.
The computer can't tell you the emotional story. It can give you the exact
mathematical design, but what's missing is the eyebrows.
The essence of Christianity is told to us in the Garden of Eden history.
The fruit that was forbidden was on the Tree of Knowledge. The subtext is,
"All the suffering you have is because you wanted to find out what was
going on. You could be in the Garden of Eden if you had just kept your
fucking mouth shut and hadn't asked any questions."
There is more stupidity than hydrogen in the universe, and it has a longer
shelf life.
There is no such thing as a dirty word. Nor is there a word so powerful,
that it's going to send the listener to the lake of fire upon hearing it.
There's no such thing as bad language. I don't believe that any more. That's
ridiculous. They call it a "debasing of the language?" No! We are adults.
These are the words that WE use, to express frustration, rage, anger―in
order that we don't pick up a tire iron and beat the shit out of someone.
I don't know if you noticed, but our two-party system is a bowl of shit
looking in the mirror at itself.
There is a big difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament,
and that is, the New Testament God is kind of a great guy (He is!), especially
when you compare him to the Old Testament God, who is a prick.
The reason you should go to Las Vegas is because, for only the second time,
the second time, ever, they have rebuilt Sodom and Gomorrah. It's back!!
And you have the opportunity to see it before it turns to salt. And you
wanna get out there before the Christian Right finds out what we're up to
and shits all over it.
[The Weather Channel] is the most watched cable channel in America. I'll
repeat that. It is the most watched cable channel in America. They were
worried about the terrorists immobilizing us, and a portion of our
countrymen watch weather. 'Kay, you don't get any more immobile than
that... unless you're in a goddamn coma. That means you're saying, "I'd go
to the window, but it's too far." If you want to know what the weather is
you go to a window and stick your hand out and if you want to know what the
temperature is you drive by a bank.
There's no such thing as soy milk. It's soy juice. But they couldn't sell
soy juice, so they called it soy milk. Because anytime you say soy juice,
you actually... start to gag.
You don't want another Enron? Here's the law: If you have a company, and it
can't explain, in one sentence... what it does... it's illegal!
The one thing I think we learned this year is that the Democrats and the
Republicans are completely worthless.
If mzero doesn't need to be a single, unambiguous value, then the algebra
of monads would seem to be a bit hinky.
We like to think we spend most of our time power-typing. "I'm being productive,
I'm writing programs!" But, we don't. We spend most of our time looking into
the abyss, saying, "My God, what have I done?"
I used to think everyone should learn programming. When I first starting
programming...I thought, "Wow, this is such an amazing way to organize
information! Everybody should learn to do this!" I don't think that any more. I
think there has to be something seriously wrong with you, in order to do this
work. A normal person, once they've looked into the abyss, will say, "I'm done.
This is stupid. I'm going to go to something else." But not us, 'cause there's
something really wrong with us.
Confusion must be avoided. Confusion is the enemy. Confusion is what causes
bugs and security mishaps and all the other things that make us miserable.
Critical thinking is the antidote to gullibility and credulity, which explains
why politicians aren't fond of critical thinking.
There's a certain freedom in being so tired that you just can't possibly do
another thing.
The president of the United States has claimed, on more than one occasion, to
be in dialogue with God. If he said that he was talking to God through his
hairdryer, this would precipitate a national emergency. I fail to see how the
addition of a hairdryer makes the claim more ridiculous or offensive.
Man is manifestly not the measure of all things. This universe is shot through
with mystery. The very fact of its being, and of our own, is a mystery
absolute, and the only miracle worthy of the name.
What is so unnerving about the candidacy of Sarah Palin is the degree to which
she represents—and her supporters celebrate—the joyful marriage of confidence
and ignorance . . . Ask yourself: how has "elitism" become a bad word in
American politics? There is simply no other walk of life in which extraordinary
talent and rigorous training are denigrated. We want elite pilots to fly our
planes, elite troops to undertake our most critical missions, elite athletes to
represent us in competition and elite scientists to devote the most productive
years of their lives to curing our diseases. And yet, when it comes time to
vest people with even greater responsibilities, we consider it a virtue to shun
any and all standards of excellence. When it comes to choosing the people whose
thoughts and actions will decide the fates of millions, then we suddenly want
someone just like us, someone fit to have a beer with, someone down-to-earth—in
fact, almost anyone, provided that he or she doesn't seem too intelligent or
well educated.
Unreason is now ascendant in the United States—in our schools, in our courts,
and in each branch of the federal government.
The point at which we fully acquire our humanity, and our capacity to suffer,
remains an open question, but anyone who would dogmatically insist that these
traits must arise coincident with the moment of conception has nothing to
contribute, apart from his ignorance, to this debate.
Water is two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen. This seems as value-free an
utterance as human beings ever make. But what do we do when someone doubts the
truth of this proposition? Ok, all we can do is appeal to scientific values.
The value of understanding the world. The value of evidence. The value of
logical consistency. What if someone says, “Well, that’s not how I choose to
think about water. Ok, what can we say to such a person? Ok, all we can do is
appeal to scientific values. And if he doesn’t share those values, the
conversation is over. Ok, if someone doesn’t value evidence, what evidence are
you going to provide to prove that they should value it? If someone doesn’t
value logic, what logical argument could you provide to show the importance of
logic?
I love living in the future. ― Bill Cheswick
Sendmail(8) proved that if you polish a turd long enough, you may eventually
end up with a shiny coprolite.
Salad is what food eats. ― Bill Cheswick
Not only do they prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race, creed
and color, but also on ability.
If, after hearing my songs, just one human being is inspired to say something
nasty to a friend, or perhaps to strike a loved one, it will all have been
worth the while.
I'm not tempted to write a song about George W. Bush. I couldn't figure out
what sort of song I would write. That's the problem: I don't want to satirise
George Bush and his puppeteers, I want to vaporize them.
I basically like "comments," though they can seem a little jarring: spit-
flecked rants that are appended to a product that at least tries for a measure
of objectivity and dignity. It's as though when you order a sirloin steak, it
comes with a side of maggots.
I disagree with those who suggest that we permanently close down the U.S. mail
on the grounds that it can kill you. That is sheer hysteria. I think we should
permanently close down the U.S. mail on the grounds that it has been making us
sick for quite a while.
Anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no
account be allowed to do the job.
Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B
very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People
living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder
what's so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to
get there and what's so great about point B that so many people from point A
are so keen to get THERE. They often wish that people would just once and for
all work out where the hell they wanted to be.
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western
Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a
distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an utterly insignificant
little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly
primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea ...
Men were real men, women were real women, and small, furry creatures from Alpha
Centauri were REAL small, furry creatures from Alpha Centauri. Spirits were
brave, men boldly split infinitives that no man had split before. Thus was the
Empire forged.
Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind- bogglingly big
it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's,
but that's just peanuts to space.
The word "spine" is, of course, an anagram of "penis". This is true in almost
fifty percent of the languages of the Galaxy, and many people have attempted to
explain why. Usually these explanations get bogged down in silly puns about
"standing erect".
There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the
Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced
by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which
states that this has already happened.
Inspiration usually comes during work, rather than before it. 
That's the way things come clear. All of a sudden. And then you realize how
obvious they've been all along. 
When we were children, we used to think that when we were grown-up we would no
longer be vulnerable. But to grow up is to accept vulnerability... To be alive
is to be vulnerable.
Because you're not what I would have you be, I blind myself to who, in truth,
you are.
A photograph is usually looked at - seldom looked into.
Dodging and burning are steps to take care of mistakes God made in
establishing tonal relationships.
In wisdom gathered over time I have found that every experience is a form of
exploration.
These people live again in print as intensely as when their images were
captured on old dry plates of sixty years ago... I am walking in their alleys,
standing in their rooms and sheds and workshops, looking in and out of their
windows. Any they in turn seem to be aware of me.
When I'm ready to make a photograph, I think I quite obviously see in my minds
eye something that is not literally there in the true meaning of the word. I'm
interested in something which is built up from within, rather than just
extracted from without.
When in doubt, tell the truth.
A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining
and wants it back the minute it begins to rain.
A classic is something that everybody wants to have read and nobody
wants to read.
[He was] a solemn, unsmiling, sanctimonious old iceberg who looked like he
was waiting for a vacancy in the Trinity.
Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you
nothing. It was here first.
I must have a prodigious quantity of mind; it takes me as much as a
week sometimes to make it up.
I was gratified to be able to answer promptly, and I did. I said I
didn't know.
If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite
you. This is the principal difference between a dog and a man.
It is by the fortune of God that, in this country, we have three benefits:
freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and the wisdom never to use either.
Man is the only animal that blushes ― or needs to.
It could probably be shown, by facts and figures, that there is no distinctly
native criminal class except Congress.
There is something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale
returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.
They spell it "da Vinci" and pronounce it "da Vinchy". Foreigners always spell
better than they pronounce.
When I was younger, I could remember anything, whether it had happened or not;
but my faculties are decaying now and soon I shall be so I cannot remember any
but the things that never happened. It is sad to go to pieces like this but we
all have to do it.
Whenever the literary German dives into a sentence, that is the last you
are going to see of him until he emerges on the other side of the Atlantic
with his verb in his mouth.
Whenever you find that you are on the side of the majority, it is time
to reform.
Why is it that we rejoice at a birth and grieve at a funeral? It is
because we are not the person involved.
But who prays for Satan? Who, in eighteen centuries, has had the common
humanity to pray for the one sinner that needed it most?
Drag your thoughts away from your troubles... by the ears, by the heels, or any
other way you can manage it.
If the world comes to an end, I want to be in Cincinnati. Everything comes
there ten years later.
Patriot: the person who can holler the loudest without knowing what he is
hollering about.
Suppose you were an idiot, and suppose you were a member of Congress. But I 
repeat myself.
There are basically two types of people. People who accomplish things, and
people who claim to have accomplished things. The first group is less crowded.
To be good is noble; but to show others how to be good is nobler and no
trouble.
Truth is mighty and will prevail. There is nothing wrong with this, except that
it ain't so.
When people do not respect us we are sharply offended; yet in his private heart
no man much respects himself.
When we remember we are all mad, the mysteries disappear and life stands
explained.
Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and
reflect.
Wit is the sudden marriage of ideas which before their union were not perceived
to have any relation.
[Silvio Berlusconi] is so thoroughly corrupt, every time he smiles, an
angel gets gonorrhea.
[Adulthood] feels like ... walking around in a desert, with a bag over
your head, bumping into people who rob you as they bore you.
Tequila isn't even a drink. It's just a way of getting the police round,
without using the phone.
I basically think I'm what would've happened if James Dean had lived,
and discovered carbohydrates and orthopedic shoes.
You want a toe? I can get you a toe, believe me. There are ways, Dude. You
don't wanna know about it, believe me.
"The Dude abides." I don't know about you but I take comfort in that. It's good
knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners. Shoosh. I
sure hope he makes the finals.
We’ve bought into the idea that education is about training and
"success", defined monetarily, rather than learning to think critically
and to challenge. We should not forget that the true purpose of education
is to make minds, not careers. A culture that does not grasp the vital
interplay between morality and power, which mistakes management techniques
for wisdom, which fails to understand that the measure of a civilization
is its compassion, not its speed or ability to consume, condemns itself
to death.
Inverted totalitarianism, unlike classical totalitarianism, does not
revolve around a demagogue or charismatic leader. It finds expression in
the anonymity of the Corporate State. It purports to cherish democracy,
patriotism, and the Constitution while manipulating internal levers.
Washington has become our Versailles. We are ruled, entertained,
and informed by courtiers―and the media has evolved into a class of
courtiers. The Democrats, like the Republicans, are mostly courtiers. Our
pundits and experts, at least those with prominent public platforms,
are courtiers. We are captivated by the hollow stagecraft of political
theater as we are ruthlessly stripped of power. It is smoke and mirrors,
tricks and con games, and the purpose behind it is deception.
The split in America, rather than simply economic, is between those who
embrace reason, who function in the real world of cause and effect, and those
who, numbed by isolation and despair, now seek meaning in a mythical world
of intuition, a world that is no longer reality-based, a world of magic.
Hope has a cost. Hope is not comfortable or easy. Hope requires personal
risk. It is not about the right attitude. Hope is not about peace of
mind. Hope is action. Hope is doing something. The more futile, the more
useless, the more irrelevant and incomprehensible an act of rebellion is,
the vaster and more potent hope becomes.  Hope never makes sense. Hope is
weak, unorganized and absurd. Hope, which is always nonviolent, exposes in
its powerlessness, the lies, fraud and coercion employed by the state. Hope
knows that an injustice visited on our neighbor is an injustice visited on
all of us. Hope posits that people are drawn to the good by the good. This
is the secret of hope's power. Hope demands for others what we demand for
ourselves. Hope does not separate us from them. Hope sees in our enemy
our own face.
Racism towards Muslims is as evil as anti-Semitism, but try to express
this simple truth on a partisan Palestinian or Israeli website.
A society without the means to detect lies and theft soon squanders its
liberty and freedom.
Really, the comforting side in most conspiracy theory arguments is the
one claiming that anyone who's in power has any plan at all.
Meetings are an addictive, highly self-indulgent activity that corporations
and other large organizations habitually engage in only because they cannot
actually masturbate.
Styling mousse, which is gunk that looks like shaving cream ... was invented
by a French hair professional whom, if you met him, you would want to punch
directly in the mouth.
There are two kinds of solar-heat systems: "passive" systems collect the
sunlight that hits your home, and "active" systems collect the sunlight
that hits your neighbors' homes, too.
There is more money being spent on breast implants and Viagra than on
Alzheimer's research. This means that by 2030, there should be a large
elderly population with perky boobs and huge erections and absolutely no
recollection of what to do with them.
It is inhumane, in my opinion, to force people who have a genuine medical
need for coffee to wait in line behind people who apparently view it as
some kind of recreational activity.
Although golf was originally restricted to wealthy, overweight Protestants,
today it's open to anybody who owns hideous clothing.
People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want
you to share yours with them.
If A equals success, then the formula is:
Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The
latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to
hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.
We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we
created them.
Man usually avoids attributing cleverness to somebody else, unless it is an
enemy.
My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior
spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive
with our frail and feeble mind.
The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it
seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the
fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving
after rational knowledge.
The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason
for existing.
God does not care about our mathematical difficulties. He integrates
empirically.
Dear Posterity, If you have not become more just, more peaceful, and generally
more rational than we are (or were) ― why then, the Devil take you.
As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not
certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.
An autocratic system of coercion, in my opinion, soon degenerates. For
force always attracts men of low morality, and I believe it to be an
invariable rule that tyrants of genius are succeeded by scoundrels.
"If I had only known, I would have been a locksmith."
"I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but
World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."
All that is valuable in human society depends upon the opportunity
for development accorded the individual. 
Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes a
touch of genius - and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.
As far as I'm concerned, I prefer silent vice to ostentatious virtue. 
Concern for man and his fate must always form the chief interest of all
technical endeavors. Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and
equations.
Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine
are still greater.
Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in
school.
Everything that can be counted does not necessarily count; everything that
counts cannot necessarily be counted.
Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre
minds.
He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my
contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the
spinal cord would suffice.
I live in that solitude which is painful in youth, but delicious in the
years of maturity.
People think my friend George is weird because he wears sideburns...behind his
ears. I think he's weird because he wears false teeth...with braces on them.
I came home the other night and tried to open the door with my car keys...and
the building started up. So I took it out for a drive. A cop pulled me over
for speeding. He asked me where I live. I said, "Here."
I was playing poker the other night... with Tarot cards. I got a full house
and 4 people died.
My brother sent me a postcard the other day with this big satellite photo of
the entire earth on it. On the back it said: "Wish you were here".
You know that feeling when you're leaning back on a stool and it starts to tip
over? Well, that's how I feel all the time.
I'm making wine at home, but I make it out of raisins, so it'll be aged
automatically.
Sponges grow in the ocean. That kills me. I wonder how much deeper the ocean
would be, if that didn't happen.
I remember the day the candle shop burned down. Everyone just stood around
and sang, "Happy birthday."
Once I stayed in a hotel where the pool was on the 23rd floor. I couldn't
believe how deep it was.
There's a fine line between fishing and standing on the shore looking like
an idiot.
What's another word for, "thesaurus?"
Once I was walking through the woods, and I saw a rabbit standing in front
of a candle, making shadows of people on a tree. I said, "Don't be so
sarcastic."
I'm a peripheral visionary. I can see into the future, but just way off to
the side.
Small keyboards make for big mistakes. 
Poetry is just the evidence of life. If your life is burning well, poetry is
just the ash.
Children show scars like medals. Lovers use them as a secrets to reveal. A
scar is what happens when the word is made flesh.
I don't consider myself a pessimist. I think of a pessimist as someone who
is waiting for it to rain. And I feel soaked to the skin.”
This is a broken world, and we live with broken hearts and broken lives,
but still that is no alibi for anything. On the contrary, you have to stand
up and say, "Hallelujah," under those circumstances.
A human is a system for converting dust billions of years ago into dust
billions of years from now via a roundabout process which involves checking
email a lot.
Among the many invectives I invent when people piss me off, this is my
current favorite: 'Fuck yer own throat, you piss-dribbling monkey dick!'
I'm hoping it catches on with you folks.
"Well, vegans, as you know, don't have eggs, meat, dairy, or senses of humor."
Holy water is often contaminated with bacteria and, as a result, I
hypothesize that Pasteur went to Hell, since, if he'd gone to heaven, all
the water would be clean."
It is ignoring the nuances of a complicated topic to grind your axe that
annoys me.
Anybody who thinks that homeopathy is appropriate therapy for anything but
thirst is ... unfit to care for patients.
There's a hell of a distance between wise-cracking and wit. Wit has truth in
it; wise-cracking is simply calisthenics with words.
If you have any young friends who aspire to become writers, the second
greatest favor you can do them is to present them with copies of The
Elements of Style. The first greatest, of course, is to shoot them now,
while they’re happy.
That would be a good thing for them to cut on my tombstone: Wherever she
went, including here, it was against her better judgment.
This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with
great force.
All those writers who write about their own childhood! Gentle God, if I
wrote about mine you wouldn't sit in the same room with me.
Sometimes, a grand adventure begins when you lick the evil. —Joe Pizzirusso
"Girls are complicated. The instruction manual that comes with girls is 800
pages, with chapters 14, 19, 26 and 32 missing, and it's badly translated,
hard to figure out."
There is no material safety data sheet for astatine. If there were, it would
just be the word "NO" scrawled over and over in charred blood.
Telling a child that everyone dies is the hardest thing about being a party
clown.
Last night, I told my kid that the night light only makes it easier for
the monsters to find her.
Okay, let's stand up and be counted: who has been writing diamond graph code? Mine's 60 lines.
Bug, undocumented behaviour, feature? I don't know. It all seems to work in 1.6.0, so everyone should downgrade now... :)
I'm always thrilled when people discover what lexical scoping really means.
My institution has a particularly diabolical policy on intellectual property, especially on software.
If you imagine that this pen is Trellis, then Lattice is not this pen.
It is good to look around at what is available, but one shouldn't miss what is under one's nose either.
What we have is nice, but we need something very different.
Readable, obvious, maintainable, 'portable' for some value of 'portable'...
'They' did write documentation that told you that Perl was needed, but 'they' can't read it for you.
Overall, SAS is about 11 years behind R and S-Plus in statistical capabilities (last year it was about 10 years behind) in my estimation.
I want a budget.
You can be maximally lazy, but still be efficient.
Andrew Thomas: ...and if something goes wrong here it is probably not WinBUGS since that has been running for more than 10 years...<x>Peter Green (from the back): ... and it still hasn't converged!
This is all documented in TFM. Those who WTFM don't want to have to WTFM again on the mailing list. RTFM.
It really is hard to anticipate just how silly users can be.
So apparently you wish to report as a bug the fact that R 1.8.0 is different from R 1.4.0.
I plan to fix this - the report is just in case I forget or get hit by a bus.
Thomas W. Blackwell: I just discovered to my surprise that I cannot define a function with an argument named 'break' or 'while'!<x>Brian D. Ripley: No, they are reserved names. [...] Most programming languages have reserved words, so I am surprised you are surprised.
R has changed quite a lot recently, and older preconceptions do need to be checked against current information.
I seem to recall that we were targetting 512k Macintoshes. In our dreams we might have seen 16Mb Sun.
When a Certain Guru rips strips off people (God knows he's done it to me often enough) on this list, there's a damned good reason for it.
Ah, so that's why my report of a bug in the RCheapViagra package didn't get through....
Henrik Bengtsson: Is there a way to turn off the (annoying) beep that occurs when one calls the locator() command and clicks the mouse? [...]<x>Brian D. Ripley: It's a feature of the windows() device. Windows is fond of beeping, and I just mute the sound.
Brian D. Ripley: Add to package utils in R-devel, after correction. I was surprised you had fallen into the 1:0 trap.<x>Patrick Burns: I'm surprised too -- good catch.
As to whether you can do a Lilliefors test for several groups, that depends entirely on your ability to understand what the underlying question would be (see Adams D 1979).
Jim Gustafsson: I would like to put my SAS-code into R. Could I do that, if yes, how?<x>Frank Harrell: Just reverse the procedure you use when you put R code into SAS. ;)
Is this English or American (you know, the language referred to in the USA as 'English')? [...] As an English English speaker, my sense and my employer's dictionary both suggest doubling here.
As Brian says, there's nothing in the design that lets you do this, but then since you have the source there's nothing on the planet to stop you doing this. The design is not a law :)
I have mentioned several times on this list that I'm in the process of developing a new and wonderful implementation of lme and I would prefer to continue working on that rather than modifying old-style code.
Ivo Welch: Thanks. I will put in a suggestion that the docs refer to q() in 'see also' for 'stop'.<x>Brian D. Ripley: I don't think anyone else is confusing 'exit' with 'stop', though. I hope you don't when driving ....
The keyboard is the standard Italian layout, which is missing the ~ (tilde) key. [...] Can anyone advice how to produce the ~ symbol, short of a copy/paste from MS Word?
I think that it's generally a good idea not to resist the most natural way of programming in R.
Sorting is a wonderful topic! Especially because you can discuss different fundamental ideas like brute force, divide and conquer, and questions of efficiency, tradeoffs of space and time, etc.
Bret Collier: I hope this is not a uniformed question, but I am a little lost.<x>Peter Dalgaard: Don't worry, they all look alike... ;-)
I was actually reading it with some curiosity as to how they managed to find 5 locations that were close to everyone on R-help...
My preference goes with the numbering scheme attributed to a tribe on some island in the Pacific which consists of a 'factor' with four levels: 'one', 'two', 'three', and 'lots'. Hence, I'd go with 'lots of R users'.
The Huli of Papua New Guinea use '15' to mean a very large number and '15 times 15 samting (something)' to mean something close to infinity.
It seems to me against the spirit of Open Source software to attempt to monitor distribution. We could ask R to 'call home' on first use (in the way e.g. pine does) but I suspect many users would find that objectionable.
Maybe you should contact Microsoft, and get them to modify their tools so they work on the R sources?
Seldom are prizes, credit, and gratitude given, else Brian would be drowning in them.
Release 1.0.0<x>(silence)<x>Wow! Thank you! [...] If I am allowed to ask just one question today: How do you fit 48 hours of coding in an ordinary day? Any hints will be appreciated ... :-)
If you give people a linear model function you give them something dangerous.
To paraphrase provocatively, 'machine learning is statistics minus any checking of models and assumptions'.
Can one be a good data analyst without being a half-good programmer? The short answer to that is, 'No.' The long answer to that is, 'No.'
For the S system, which has forever altered the way people analyze, visualize, and manipulate data .... S is an elegant, widely accepted, and enduring software system, with conceptual integrity, thanks to the insight, taste, and effort of John Chambers.
Some of us feel that type III sum of squares and so-called ls-means are statistical nonsense which should have been left in SAS.
SAS seems to be to statistical computing what Microsoft is to personal computing.
Zhu Wang: I am trying to create a library which uses some Fortran source files [...]<x>Douglas Bates: Someone named Martin Maechler will shortly be sending you email regarding the distinction between 'library' and 'package' :-)
Let's not kid ourselves: the most widely used piece of software for statistics is Excel.
John Miller: How do I prevent google search to post my questions asked here??<x>Martin Maechler: you don't: R-help is famous and celebrity can't be gotten rid off ;-)
I use R. My company benefits from it. My clients benefit from it.<x>...and I sleep just fine (when I do sleep)... :-)
Please bear with a poor newbee, who might be doing everything backwards (I was brought up in pure math).
However, if you want to do this at all efficiently for a data frame, start with my solution not Uwe's [...]
/* some real insanity to keep Duncan sane */
Soon, they'll be speaking R on the subway.
Ted Harding: But you can also do these with 'any' and 'all', e.g. any(v==TRUE).<x>Thomas Lumley: or any( (v==TRUE)==TRUE), or any( ((v==TRUE)==TRUE)==TRUE)... Or, perhaps, any(v). Lewis Carroll wrote a nice piece on this theme.
So good advice here is: Beware of good advice about this. (Of course, I may just be an outlier ...)
So it ***do not refuse*** to read the data. I do not expect some dwarf climbs out from your computer and says he will not read your data. Or is he?<x>?read.table gives you more details about how to read some data.
These road distances seem to be very non-Euclidean indeed (even non-metric). It seems to be 2282km from Athens to Milan if you go directly, but if you go via Rome it is only 1403km. I thought that World is non-Euclidean, but not that obviously.
Eric Lecoutre: I don't want to die being idiot...<x>Peter Dalgaard: With age, most of us come to realise that that is the only possible outcome.
Firstly, don't call your matrix 'matrix'. Would you call your dog 'dog'? Anyway, it might clash with the function 'matrix'.
R is the lingua franca of statistical research. Work in all other languages should be discouraged.
Tony Plate: It is the prerogative of the members of R-core to decide whether to spend their time on improving documentation or improving the functionality (or merely having a life).<x>Patrick Burns: I thought we had agreed that members of R-core are not allowed lives.
Obviously I have not tested on an Alphabc...tuvwxyz system but it should work there.
There are companies whose yearly license fees to SAS total millions of dollars. Then those companies hire armies of SAS programmers to program an archaic macro language using old statistical methods to produce ugly tables and the worst graphics in the statistical software world.
I believe functions should do what they say on the box (and the help page), and not what some user hopes they might do by mind-reading.
Getting flamed for asking dumb questions on a public mailing list is all part of growing up and being a man/woman.
You may have not been long enough on this list to see that some of the old-time gurus have reached a demigod like status. Demigods have all rights to be 'rude' (that's almost a definition of a demi-deity).
Suggesting a Usenet newsgroup is a generation thing. I think some of the younger users would prefer a Wiki or a Forum (these are words I've seen, but I wouldn't visit places like this, talking about my g-g-generation).
Robin Hankin: I'd say that without a tool like R you cannot learn statistics.<x>David Whiting: I believe Fisher and a few others managed to get by without it.<x>Peter Dalgaard: But think how far they could have got with R!
If you don't go with R now, you will someday.
I have never heard anyone (knowledgable or otherwise) claim that, in the absence of transition costs, SAS is better than R for equity modeling. If you come across any such claim, I would be happy to refute it.
Will Frank Harrell or someone else please explain to me a real application in which this is not fast enough?
Achim Zeileis: Other visualizations of departures from indepence include mosaicplots with shading or association plots. See mosaicplot() and assocplot() and the package vcd.<x>Peter Dalgaard: I see that you've taken initive to abbriate statiscal concepts...
Also, that's what Martin Maechler told me and he wrote the code so I trust him on that. I figure that if you have to trust someone to be meticulous and precise then a German-speaking Swiss is a good choice.
Well, if I had written that, it would have been on purpose ...
I'm not sure I'd trust any computer recommendation from 1976, no matter how famous the authors are.
Marc R. Feldesman: I'm trying to figure out what could have possibly changed [...] that make Brian Ripley's posts (in particular) not show up on my mail server [...]<x>Peter Dalgaard: Did you remember to turn off the Oxford-sarcasm filter?
Jesus and the rest of the R-help community: Thanks for your help.
If the answer is parse() you should usually rethink the question.
Just now I had an apparently insurmountable problem that's been bugging me for days, but phrasing my question in a form suitable for the R-help list enabled me to solve my own problem in two minutes flat.<x>Thanks everyone.
Actually, I see it as part of my job to inflict R on people who are perfectly happy to have never heard of it. Happiness doesn't equal proficient and efficient. In some cases the proficiency of a person serves a greater good than their momentary happiness.
Evelyn Hall: I would like to know how (if) I can extract some of the information from the summary of my nlme.<x>Simon Blomberg: This is R. There is no if. Only how.
Tradition among experienced S programmers has always been that loops (typically 'for' loops) are intrinsically inefficient: expressing computations without loops has provided a measure of entry into the inner circle of S programming.
You can't expect statistical procedures to rescue you from poor data.
I think we can reject the null hypothesis of "Dirk can type" at all convential significance levels.
The problem, as always, is what the heck does one mean by 'outlier' in these contexts. Seems to be like pornography -- "I know it when I see it."
[...] (damn... my shift key just broke as well...)<x>bill venables.
It is a mistake to assume that everything is known about even the common approximations used in statistical practice, and this area is still opening up.
As for elegance, R is refined, tasteful, and beautiful. When I grow up, I want to marry R.
Rene M. Raupp: Does anybody know any work comparing R with other (charged) statistical software (like Minitab, SPSS, SAS)? [...] I have to show it's as good as the others.<x>Kjetil Brinchmann Halvorsen: Sorry. That will be difficult. Couldn't it do to prove it is better?
You're overlooking something like line 800 of the documentation for xyplot. [...] It's probably in the R-FAQ as well, since my original feeling was that this behaviour was chosen in order to confuse people and see how many people read the FAQ... :)
I suggest that we redefine "+" to be a legal character in the name of an identifier. Sure, if you used to have "a+b" you'll have to rewrite it as "+(a,b)", but think of the benefits! You+can+write+out+long+sentences+and+use+them+as+variable+names!
Oops. Was that what I was expecting?
Well, 'do as we say, not do as we do' applies, I think.
See pages 45 and 46 of V&R's S PROGRAMMING for a definitive discussion of how to do this.<x>(Confession: I treat anything that V&R say as definitive).
A big computer, a complex algorithm and a long time does not equal science.
Uwe Ligges: I just told nonsense, stepclass() does not make sense with randomForest(), obviously ... (wonder why nobody shouted?).<x>Douglas Bates: Oh, we're just so used to you talking nonsense that we don't bother to point it out any more :-)
The fact that some people murder doesn't mean we should copy them. And murdering data, though not as serious, should also be avoided.
The learning curve is steep - but then like many people, I'd like to be able to do sophisticated modelling with deep understanding and no effort :-)
Excellent, Berwin!<x>Specifically the part about why the bug never really triggers wrong behavior. Your mail should be saved in 'The Annals of R' ...
You say yourself it wasn't reproducible. So it could have been anything that "crashed" your R, cosmic radiation, a bolt of lightning reversing a bit in your computer memory, ... :-)
It was simple, but you know, it's always simple when you've done it.
If you aren't sure of the relative priority of two operators, use parentheses. 1:(nr-1) would work regardless of whether : or - had higher priority. Or, in extreme cases, read the documentation.
It is wrong to blame ANY tool for our own shortcomings!
Jason Horn: Can anyone think of a way to create a pretty() sequence that excludes zero? Or a way to remove the zero from a sequence after using pretty()?<x>Peter Dalgaard: The former is rather hard because zero is generally considered just about the prettiest number around...
Does anyone know someone working in this area in France who is not a JARP (Just Another R Person)?
Contrary to popular belief the speed of R's interpreter is rarely the limiting factor to R's speed. People treating R like C is typically the limiting factor. You have vector operations, USE THEM.
Mathematical conventions are just that, conventions. They differ by field of mathematics. Don't ask us why matrix rows are numbered down but graphs are numbered up the y axis, nor why x comes before y but row before column. But the matrix layout has always seemed illogical to me.
And the fear of getting Ripleyed on the mailing list also makes me think, read, and improve before submitting half baked questions to the list.
Ole F. Christensen: Brain, Thank you very much for your help.<x>Peter Dalgaard: You seem to be using call-by-value semantics rather than call-by-name...
Thomas Lumley: The precedence of ^ is higher than that of unary minus. It may be surprising, [...]<x>Herve Pages: No, it's not surprising. At least to me... In the country where I grew up, I've been teached that -x^2 means -(x^2) not (-x)^2.
The wiki spamming is a serious problem, [...]. What does a logfile with IPs help? The spammers are strangers selling viagra. I don't want to find them :-)
Any doubts about R's big-league status should be put to rest, now that we have a Sudoku Puzzle Solver. Take that, SAS!
Lastly, by what we could call the 'Liaw-Baron principle', every question that can be asked has in fact already been asked.
It's not a question of trying variations, rather of following instructions.
Please do think hard before you tell other people what they 'should' do for you.
It might surprise many R-help posters, but R has manuals as well...
Michael Watson: Hopefully this one isn't in the manual or I am about to get shot :-S<x>Peter Dalgaard: *Kapow*...
My solution when I run into mysteries like this is to put 'browser()' in the function just before or after the line of interest. The magnitude and direction of my stupidity usually become clear quickly.
Similarly to Brian, I'm much more reluctant to help people who don't exist -- who knows, maybe you're a computer program who has just passed the Turing test :-)
(3 times...rrrrgh...) and why do you think the mailing list is called R-*packages* ???????????<x>Please do<x>  for(i in 1:20) cat("It's a package!\n")
If we do that, I predict that the total amount of r-help time wasted on it will exceed the CPU time saved by orders of magnitude.
This has been discussed before in this list, and Ripley said "no, no!". I do it all the time, but only in secrecy.
2-D pie charts are terrible. That makes 3-D pie charts terrible to the 3/2 power.

Duncan Murdoch: Others need to run under ESS.<x>Francois Pinard: While this is a good things for Emacs lovers, the requirement is rather unwelcome for pagans! :-)
Statistical computing is not easy, so how could R be? Who has ever claimed it is? Any package that makes statistical computing appear to be easy is probably giving you wrong answers half the time, or is extremely limited in scope.
It is unusual for the actual data not to be available in real problems.
Warning: Although abusing R was not proved to be addictive, it should be noted that it often leads to harder stuff.
I wish <<- had never been invented, as it makes an esoteric and dangerous feature of the language *seem* normal and reasonable. If you want to dumb down R/S into a macro language, this is the operator for you.
You need to prepare your students for the future, not the past.
Have you ever wanted to write a book, but not known where to start? Now is a very good time to jump in, because there is currently a very simple recipe for success: just put R in the title and you will have to beat the publishers off with a stick!
This is at best a matter of opinion, and credentials do matter for opinions.
If you want to do an integer divide, you should only use integers to divide with.
Personally I have never regretted trying not to underestimate my own future stupidity.
Brian Ripley: Where did you tell it [...]? (Nowhere: R is lacking a mind_read() function!)<x>Peter Dalgaard: Please stop complaining about missing features. Patches will be considered.<x><x>Oh, it's you, Brian. Never mind then. You'll get to it, I'm sure. ;-)
Just [use] MinGW like R [does], following the guides to the letter gets you there like marked stones across a marsh. Leaving the path usually gets you at best neck deep in the mire, alternatively just bubbles.
I don't like to see the use of c() for its side effects. In this case Marc's as.vector seems to me to be self-explanatory, and that is a virtue in programming that is too often undervalued.
I cannot remember if I have been using 14 or 14, I think it was 14 and I am not near the machine to check.

Perhaps one is the real forge and the other is a forgery? Or a forge-R-y? I'll get my coat...
It is all too easy for statistical thinking to be swamped by programming tasks.
R is being used for different purposes than the original interactive EDA environment.
RAM is cheap and thinking hurts.
All this becomes even more glaring if you take the unusal step of plotting the data.
What sort of editor would overlook this clear and demonstrable message leaping out from the data in favour of some arcane argument about "types of sums of squares"? Several answers come to mind: A power freak, a SAS afficianado, an idiot.
If you really want to assess uncertainty you need to take into account that the models are false and that several models may capture different aspects of the data and so be false in different ways.
If anything, there should be a Law: Thou Shalt Not Even Think Of Producing A Graph That Looks Like Anything From A Spreadsheet.
Friends don't let friends use Excel for statistics!
Anand Patil: Can this be fixed without requiring the user to do anything?<x>Brian D. Ripley: The fix requires 'the user' to read the documentation.
Bad English is the language of science.

Apparently mathematical impossibility is not an impediment to parameter estimation in such cases.

Gustaf Rydevik: The author also has some thought-provoking opinions on R being no-good and that you should write everything in C.<x>Paul Gilbert: People used to say assembler, that's progress.
I strongly suggest you collaborate with a local statistician. I can think of no circumstance where multiple regression on "hundreds of thousands of variables" is anything more than a fancy random number generator.
In many cases a) often looks difficult, but on closer inspection turns out to be impossible.
Basically R is reluctant to let you shoot yourself in the foot unless you are really determined to do so.
R may be the wrong tool for the job, but it's the wrong job.
Kenn Konstabel: [...] There's more to this trend: SPSS and Statistica now advertise "R language support": [...]<x>Charles C. Berry: If you can't beat R, join R.<x>Marc Schwartz: "Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated." 
As for the question of the bug in `is', ... it depends what your definition of `is' is.
I still don't know what to do about the compromise between how statistics should be done and how journal editors seem to insist it should be done ...
Nothing exceeds like Excel.
Cross posting is sociopathic.
Some people familiar with R describe it as a supercharged version of Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet software.
I think [R] addresses a niche market for high-end data analysts that want free, readily available code. [...] We have customers who build engines for aircraft. I am happy they are not using freeware when I get on a jet.
It's interesting that SAS Institute feels that non-peer-reviewed software with hidden implementations of analytic methods that cannot be reproduced by others should be trusted when building aircraft engines.
This sounds like you have discovered homeopathic properties in Sweave! It will be serious if input files remember errors even after they have been removed.
One of the beauties of S and R is the syntax closeness to mathematical notation. Many of us know that Lisp has beauties that S can never have, but that's really in different beauty-space.
R is Open Source and so you can modify it to emulate the bugs in other software: that is not one of the aims of its developers so please don't expect us to do so for you.
The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data.
I must say I feel very uneasy about giving advice on how to use R as a pre-processor for something that is to be done in Excel, but we are a broad church here!
No matter how much progress is made by the developers of screen readers somehow PDF remains less than accessible. It's a bit like a failed relationship in which one partner tries to win the other back with expensive gifts.
As the name says, studentizing is left as an easy student exercise. Destudentizing is more difficult and usually called professorizing.
Hmm. I don't ever use R-squared, so I didn't implement it.
Trellis graphics are a bit like hash functions: you can be close to the target, but get a far-off result.
The only people who should use the assign function are those who fully understand why you should never use the assign function.
4 bits are not enough for me!

Dear Uwe, thank you very much for your unvaluable time and effort.
If I were to be treated by a cure created by stepwise regression, I would prefer voodoo.
If one doesn't understand the output of lm(), then one's knowledge of statistics is insufficient to warrant using lm().
If 'fools rush in where angels fear to tread', then Bayesians 'jump' in where frequentists fear to 'step'.
You are going to need a few more sessions for this therapy to be useful, we cannot read your computer's mind, just interpret what you tell us. I don't want to jump ahead, but can you tell us the childhood of your crashes, etc.
It currently works (because I can't figure out how to make it an error) but you really should not do it.
There's an informal tradition that those announcements [about R releases] contain at least one mistake, but apparently I forgot this time, so users have to make up their own....
It appears to me that you do not understand even basic statistics. As a corollary to that impression I would suggest that giving you advice about the use of R for scientific investigation could be morally similar to giving you advice about how to do your own household wiring.
In general, it's much easier to create output from a R object than create an R object from output.
As Obi-Wan Kenobi may have said in Star Wars: "Use the source, Luke!"
Finally, a word of wisdom from a long-ago engineering colleague: "Whenever I see an outlier, I'm never sure whether to throw it away or patent it."
As one of the developers of the nls function I would like to state that the lack of automatic ANOVA, R^2 and adj. R^2 from nls is a feature, not a bug :-)
My best advice regarding R^2 statistics with nonlinear models is, as Nancy Reagan suggested, "Just say no.".
The widespread use of spreadsheets or SPSS data sets or SAS data sets which encourage the "single table with a gargantuan number of columns, most of which are missing data in most cases" approach to organization of longitudinal data is regrettable.
R is a complex program. If you can't work out how to find the documentation, I doubt you will be able to use R.
If your ultimate interest is in real scientific progress, I'd suggest that you ignore that sentence (and any conclusion drawn subsequent to it).
I begin to think that R needs a _mis_fortunes package...
Only with a very high signal to noise ratio (e.g., high true R^2) can torturing data lead to a confession to something other than what the analyst wants to hear.
If you don't want informative help files, it's really not much work to make uninformative ones.
Soham: How to compute the p-value of a statistic generally?<x>Berton Gunter: runif(1)
Karl Ove Hufthammer: Why not use 'predict.loess' (i.e., 'predict' on a loess object) directly?<x>Greg Snow: Because that would be simple, straightforward, and make sense, and not require knowledge about less obvious functions.
There are actual error messages, and until you show them, we can not help as the mind reading machine is currently off for repairs.

datayoda: Bing is my friend...I found the cumsum() function.<x>Dirk Eddelbuettel: If bing is your friend, then rseek.org is bound to be your uncle.
This is one of those cases, in my opinion, where R's documentation drops you into a flat landscape, in the middle of nowhere, in a thick mist.
I used a heuristic... pulled from my posterior. That makes it Bayesian, right?
If you can do with[out a] Makefile, do without a Makefile.

There is a reason that the speedometer in your car doesn't just read "slow" and "fast".
The style for JSS now enforces (via Achimitization) the use of quotes.
Although there is almost never a "No" in R, the best short answer is: "No".

Sorry, but this is the R-help list.  The 'R Spam' list is over at /dev/null.
You might also consider a more informative subject line. "Help needed" is true for all questions (not answers) on R-help. Just think, why is this list called R-***help***?
I think this is kind of like asking "will your Land Rover make it up my driveway?", but I'll assume the question was asked in all seriousness.
Joshua Wiley: ... the advantages of formal classes seem worth at least not entirely dismissing.<x>Jim Lemon: Hmmm, yeah, that's about the grammatical equivalent of S4 classes.
For recursive objects, search for recursive objects.
Most people pay infinitely more to Microsoft for Windows than they pay to R Core for R. I hope that's also the ratio of their complaints to Microsoft about this bug to their complaints to us about R.
The trouble with nonstandard evaluation is that it doesn't follow standard evaluation rules...
Well..... SAS is SAS, but R is FREE...
It is becoming apparent that you do not know how to use the results from either system. The progress of science would be safer if you get some advice from a person that knows what they are doing.
For quite a while, bug-for-bug compatibility with S-PLUS v 3.x was considered important to allow people to port their packages between systems.
Thank your for your entry in the Poorly Capitalized and Inadequately Searched Posting Contest. You will be advised of your ranking in due course.
Don't do as I say, do as Hadley does.
R is wonderful, but it cannot work magic.
If we told you all of R's secrets, we'd have to kill you.
I know barely more than zero about R: until yesterday I didn't know how to spell it.
As with many tools in this domain, for effective use they require more knowledge than many of their users possess, and can be dangerous because they seem to "work".
Unfortunately, this is one of those situations where as far as I can tell all of the real statisticians are out there playing with large data sets where the small-sample corrections are not so important and leaving the rest of us to figure it out for ourselves...
David Winsemius: Any of your staff can view the (open) source code just as any other member of the human race.<x>Uwe Ligges: I do not think the GPL excludes other species...
I think the amount of people on this list who understand your question is roughly zero.
It's not meant for sampling weights. It's meant for precision weights. How best to include sampling weights in mixed models is a research problem at the moment, but you can rely on getting the wrong answer if you just use the weights= argument.

The problem here is that the $ notation is a magical shortcut and like any other magic if used incorrectly is likely to do the programmatic equivalent of turning yourself into a toad.
That's a casual model, not a causal model - you can tell the difference by looking for the word "excel".
Careful now, or I'll get into a rant about how much you pay for ArcGIS and whether you are getting value for money if bugs become 'well-known'! Bugs in R tend to be either 'obscure' or 'fixed' :)
Igor Sosa Mayor: The problem is that it gives the result that I want.<x>Sarah Goslee: That's a new sort of problem.
R is a strange, deeply flawed language that nevertheless has an enthusiastic and rapidly growing user base. What about R accounts for its popularity in its niche? What can language designers learn from R's success?
Finally, as author of the code used to put CG in optim, I'll advise against its use. One of my least successful pieces of code. Rcgmin is better, but you really do need analytic derivatives to make it sing. For 5 parameters, use NM, or better the nmk from dfoptim package.
Some OSX users know that OSX is really Unix [...], others think that OSX is cooler Windows, and they have ontological problems with non-Apple phenomena and constructs.

I wish there was a better way for me to learn this stuff than constantly being wrong in public.
The computational ease with which an abundance of parameters can be estimated should not be allowed to obscure the probable unwisdom of such estimation from limited data.
I thought RStudio was amazing, but RStudio with knitr is approximately `formatC(round(runif(1, 1e8, 1e9)), digits=10, big.mark=',')` times better than RStudio alone!
Awkwardly worded questions will get much better answers if they are accompanied by some test data.

I think that the formula language does allow expressions with '/' to represent nested factors but I can't check right now as there is a fire in the building where my office is located. I prefer to simply write nested factors as factor1 + factor1:factor2.
Bandwidth selection is an unresolved (and possibly unsolvable) problem in smoothing, so you're perfectly justified in trying/choosing an arbitrary value if it produces good pictures!
Rickyfox: Dang it how could I have missed this? Thx for the answer, I feel incredibly stupid now.<x>Juba: Never underestimate the power of R to make you feel stupid.
If things are not readily available in R it is always good to pause and reflect if there might be a good reason.
Sooner or later most R beginners are bitten by this all too convenient shortcut. As an R newbie, think of R as your bank account: overuse of $-extraction can lead to undesirable consequences. It's best to acquire the '[[' and '[' habit early.
Most optimization problems have more than one answer, and the "wrong" ones often seem to be easier to find.

I'm still confused about how to avoid the wrath of the CRAN-devel daemon, whose appetite for new morsels of developer flesh seems ever increasing and makes keeping even a stable package up-to-date a moving target.
Maybe I'll become a theoretician. Nobody expects you to maintain a theorem.
Bert Gunter: However, I do not understand the substitute(...()) idiom. Would you care to explain it? (No is an acceptable answer!).<x>Bill Dunlap: I don't completely understand it either, I treat it as an idiom. I saw it on this list once.

You seem to be falling prey to a common misconception that "R" is some monolithic tool, when in fact it is a herd of cats.
Basically, you are calling .Internal from the command line. It is not designed to be called from there and only wizards know what happens if it is. (The set of wizards who might know whether it makes any sense at all does not include me!)

Welcome to the wonderful world of heterogeneity (tau^2) estimators in meta-analysis. The question of which estimator to choose never fails to provide fun and entertainment for the entire family and I predict that it will do so for generations to come. Please quote me on that!
The urge to imitate other statistical packages that rely on profusion of dummies should be resisted. R repression functions can handle factor variables.
It will be included in the next version of devtools - it's totally do-able, but no one has done it yet.
Ooops, that was answering the question you actually asked. The one you meant to ask is answered by this part:<x>The sort order for character vectors will depend on the collating sequence of the locale in use: see Comparison.

You should try things; R won't break.
Please don't apply R like a magic answers box, because you can mislead others and cause harm.
Your example requires all choices of 1541 out of 3000, which I would expect to take somewhere near age-of-the-universe seconds to compute. The code uses a clever nested computation due to Gail et al which will cut that time down to infinity/10.

It is a very humbling experience to make a multimillion-dollar mistake, but it
is also very memorable.  I vividly recall the night we decided how to organize
the actual writing of external specifications for OS/360.  The manager of
architecture, the manager of control program implementation, and I were
threshing out the plan, schedule, and division of responsibilities.
The architecture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted that they could write
the specifications and do it right.  It would take ten months, three more
than the schedule allowed.
The control program manager had 150 men.  He asserted that they could prepare
the specifications, with the architecture team coordinating; it would be
well-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.  Furthermore, if
the architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling their thumbs
for ten months.
To this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control program
team the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time, but would
also be three months late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and it was.  He
was right on both counts.  Moreover, the lack of conceptual integrity made
the system far more costly to build and change, and I would estimate that it
added a year to debugging time.
The reason ESP, for example, is not considered a viable topic in contemoprary
psychology is simply that its investigation has not proven fruitful...After
more than 70 years of study, there still does not exist one example of an ESP
phenomenon that is replicable under controlled conditions.  This simple but
basic scientific criterion has not been met despite dozens of studies
conducted over many decades...It is for this reason alone that the topic is
now of little interest to psychology...In short, there is no demonstrated
phenomenon that needs explanation.

I have sacrificed time, health, and fortune, in the desire to complete these
Calculating Engines.  I have also declined several offers of great personal
advantage to myself.  But, notwithstanding the sacrifice of these advantages
for the purpose of maturing an engine of almost intellectual power, and after
expending from my own private fortune a larger sum than the government of
England has spent on that machine, the execution of which it only commenced,
I have received neither an acknowledgement of my labors, not even the offer
of those honors or rewards which are allowed to fall within the reach of men
who devote themselves to purely scientific investigations...
If the work upon which I have bestowed so much time and thought were a mere
triumph over mechanical difficulties, or simply curious, or if the execution
of such engines were of doubtful practicability or utility, some justification
might be found for the course which has been taken; but I venture to assert
that no mathematician who has a reputation to lose will ever publicly express
an opinion that such a machine would be useless if made, and that no man
distinguished as a civil engineer will venture to declare the construction of
such machinery impracticable...
And at a period when the progress of physical science is obstructed by that
exhausting intellectual and manual labor, indispensable for its advancement,
which it is the object of the Analytical Engine to relieve, I think the
application of machinery in aid of the most complicated and abtruse
calculations can no longer be deemed unworthy of the attention of the country.
In fact, there is no reason why mental as well as bodily labor should not
be economized by the aid of machinery.

I believe that part of what propels science is the thirst for wonder.  It's a
very powerful emotion.  All children feel it.  In a first grade classroom
everybody feels it; in a twelfth grade classroom almost nobody feels it, or
at least acknowledges it.  Something happens between first and twelfth grade,
and it's not just puberty.  Not only do the schools and the media not teach
much skepticism, there is also little encouragement of this stirring sense
of wonder.  Science and pseudoscience both arouse that feeling.  Poor
popularizations of science establish an ecological niche for pseudoscience.
If science were explained to the average person in a way that is accessible
and exciting, there would be no room for pseudoscience.  But there is a kind
of Gresham's Law by which in popular culture the bad science drives out the
good.  And for this I think we have to blame, first, the scientific community
ourselves for not doing a better job of popularizing science, and second, the
media, which are in this respect almost uniformly dreadful.  Every newspaper
in America has a daily astrology column.  How many have even a weekly
astronomy column?  And I believe it is also the fault of the educational
system.  We do not teach how to think.  This is a very serious failure that
may even, in a world rigged with 60,000 nuclear weapons, compromise the human
future.

to me if there weren't extraterrestrial intelligence, but of course there is as
yet no compelling evidence for it.  And then I'm asked, "Yeah, but what do you
really think?"  I say, "I just told you what I really think."  "Yeah, but
what's your gut feeling?"  But I try not to think with my gut.  Really, it's

The characteristic property of hallucinogens, to suspend the boundaries between
the experiencing self and the outer world in an ecstatic, emotional experience,
makes it possible with their help, and after suitable internal and external
perparation...to evoke a mystical experience according to plan, so to speak...
I see the true importance of LSD in the possibility of providing material aid
to meditation aimed at the mystical experience of a deeper, comprehensive
reality.  Such a use accords entirely with the essence and working character
of LSD as a sacred drug.
I share the belief of many of my contemporaries that the spiritual crisis
pervading all spheres of Western industrial society can be remedied only
by a change in our world view.  We shall have to shift from the materialistic,
dualistic belief that people and their environment are separate, toward a
new consciousness of an all-encompassing reality, which embraces the
experiencing ego, a reality in which people feel their oneness with animate
nature and all of creation.
Deliberate provocation of mystical experience, particularly by LSD and related
hallucinogens, in contrast to spontaneous visionary experiences, entails
dangers that must not be underestimated.  Practitioners must take into
account the peculiar effects of these substances, namely their ability to
influence our consciousness, the innermost essence of our being.  The history
of LSD to date amply demonstrates the catastrophic consequences that can
ensue when its profound effect is misjudged and the substance is mistaken
for a pleasure drug.  Special internal and external advance preparations
are required; with them, an LSD experiment can become a meaningful
experience.
I believe that if people would learn to use LSD's vision-inducing capability
more wisely, under suitable conditions, in medical practice and in conjuction
with meditation, then in the future this problem child could become a wonder
child.

There is a difference, and this is a difference, we might say, between

mistakes.  Postjudice is not terrible.  You can't be perfect of course; you
may make mistakes also.  But it is permissible to make a judgment after you
have examined the evidence.  In some circles it is even encouraged.

The challenge of space exploration and particularly of landing men on the moon
represents the greatest challenge which has ever faced the human race.  Even
if there were no clear scientific or other arguments for proceeding with this
task, the whole history of our civilization would still impel men toward the
goal.  In fact, the assembly of the scientific and military with these human
arguments creates such an overwhelming case that in can be ignored only by
those who are blind to the teachings of history, or who wish to suspend the
development of civilization at its moment of greatest opportunity and drama.
The idea of man leaving this earth and flying to another celestial body and
landing there and stepping out and walking over that body has a fascination
and a driving force that can get the country to a level of energy, ambition,
and will that I do not see in any other undertaking.  I think if we are
honest with ourselves, we must admit that we needed that impetus extremely
strongly.  I sincerely believe that the space program, with its manned
landing on the moon, if wisely executed, will become the spearhead for a
broad front of courageous and energetic activities in all the fields of
endeavour of the human mind - activities which could not be carried out
except in a mental climate of ambition and confidence which such a spearhead
can give.
Human society - man in a group - rises out of its lethargy to new levels of

social accomplishment.
The vigor of civilized societies is preserved by the widespread sense that high
aims are worth-while.  Vigorous societies harbor a certain extravagance of
objectives, so that men wander beyond the safe provision of personal
gratifications.  All strong interests easily become impersonal, the love of

they prevailed with irrefutable data.  More often, egregious findings that
contradict well-established research turn out to be artifacts.  I have
argued that accepting psychic powers, reincarnation, "cosmic consciousness,"
and the like, would entail fundamental revisions of the foundations of
neuroscience.  Before abandoning materialist theories of mind that have paid
handsome dividends, we should insist on better evidence for psi phenomena
than presently exists, especially when neurology and psychology themselves
offer more plausible alternatives.
Evolution is as much a fact as the earth turning on its axis and going around
the sun.  At one time this was called the Copernican theory; but, when
evidence for a theory becomes so overwhelming that no informed person
can doubt it, it is customary for scientists to call it a fact.  That all
present life descended from earlier forms, over vast stretches of geologic
time, is as firmly established as Copernican cosmology.  Biologists differ
only with respect to theories about how the process operates.

The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events, the firmer
becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered
regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him neither the rule of
human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural
events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural
events could never be refuted, in the real sense, by science, for this
doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge
has not yet been able to set foot.
But I am persuaded that such behavior on the part of the representatives
of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine which
is able to maintain itself not in clear light, but only in the dark, will
of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human
progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion
must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is,
give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast
powers in the hands of priests.  In their labors they will have to avail
themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the
True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself.  This is, to be sure, a more
difficult but an incomparably more worthy task.

Is it not a spectacle to make the angels laugh?  We are a company of
ignorant beings, feeling our way through mists and darkness, learning only
be incessantly repeated blunders, obtaining a glimmering of truth by
falling into every conceivable error, dimly discerning light enough for
our daily needs, but hopelessly differing whenever we attempt to describe
the ultimate origin or end of our paths; and yet, when one of us ventures
to declare that we don't know the map of the universe as well as the map
of our infinitesimal parish, he is hooted, reviled, and perhaps told that
he will be damned to all eternity for his faithlessness...
Till then we shall be content to admit openly, what you (religionists)
whisper under your breath or hide in technical jargon, that the ancient
secret is a secret still; that man knows nothing of the Infinite and
Absolute; and that, knowing nothing, he had better not be dogmatic about
his ignorance.  And, meanwhile, we will endeavour to be as charitable as
possible, and whilst you trumpet forth officially your contempt for our
skepticism, we will at least try to believe that you are imposed upon
by your own bluster.

However, on religious issues there can be little or no compromise.
There is no position on which people are so immovable as their religious
beliefs.  There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than
Jesus Christ, or God, or Allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being.
But like any powerful weapon, the use of God's name on one's behalf
should be used sparingly.  The religious factions that are growing
throughout our land are not using their religious clout with wisdom.
They are trying to force government leaders into following their position
100 percent.  If you disagree with these religious groups on a
particular moral issue, they complain, they threaten you with a loss of
money or votes or both.  I'm frankly sick and tired of the political
preachers across this country telling me as a citizen that if I want to be
a moral person, I must believe in "A," "B," "C," and "D."  Just who do
they think they are?  And from where do they presume to claim the
right to dictate their moral beliefs to me?  And I am even more angry as
a legislator who must endure the threats of every religious group who
thinks it has some God-granted right to control my vote on every roll
call in the Senate.  I am warning them today:  I will fight them every
step of the way if they try to dictate their moral convictions to all
Americans in the name of "conservatism."
"I think every good Christian ought to kick Falwell's ass."
...And no philosophy, sadly, has all the answers.  No matter how assured
we may be about certain aspects of our belief, there are always painful
inconsistencies, exceptions, and contradictions.  This is true in religion as
it is in politics, and is self-evident to all except fanatics and the naive.
As for the fanatics, whose number is legion in our own time, we might be
advised to leave them to heaven.  They will not, unfortunately, do us the
same courtesy.  They attack us and each other, and whatever their
protestations to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history makes clear
that they are easily disposed to resort to the sword.  My own belief in
God, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge.  My respect
for Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems to have been the
most virtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth.  But even well-educated Christians
are frustrated in their thirst for certainty about the beloved figure
of Jesus because of the undeniable ambiguity of the scriptural record.
Such ambiguity is not apparent to children or fanatics, but every
recognized Bible scholar is perfectly aware of it.  Some Christians, alas,
resort to formal lying to obscure such reality.

As I argued in "Beloved Son", a book about my son Brian and the subject
of religious communes and cults, one result of proper early instruction
in the methods of rational thought will be to make sudden mindless
conversions -- to anything -- less likely.  Brian now realizes this and
has, after eleven years, left the sect he was associated with.  The
problem is that once the untrained mind has made a formal commitment to
a religious philosophy -- and it does not matter whether that philosophy
is generally reasonable and high-minded or utterly bizarre and
irrational -- the powers of reason are surprisingly ineffective in
changing the believer's mind.
We may not be able to persuade Hindus that Jesus and not Vishnu should
govern their spiritual horizon, nor Moslems that Lord Buddha is at the
center of their spiritual universe, nor Hebrews that Mohammed is a major
prohpet, nor Christians that Shinto best expresses their spiritual
concerns, to say nothing of the fact that we may not be able to get
Christians to agree among themselves about their relationship to God.
But all will agree on a proposition that they possess profound spiritual
resources.  If, in addition, we can get them to accept the further
proposition that whatever form the Deity may have in their own theology,
the Deity is not only external, but internal and acts through them, and
they themselves give proof or disproof of the Deity in what they do and
think; if this further proposition can be accepted, then we come that
much closer to a truly religious situation on earth.
The Messiah will come.  There will be a resurrection of the dead -- all
the things that Jews believed in before they got so damn sophisticated.
If one inquires why the American tradition is so strong against any
connection of State and Church, why it dreads even the rudiments of
religious teaching in state-maintained schools, the immediate and
superficial answer is not far to seek....
The cause lay largely in the diversity and vitality of the various
denominations, each fairly sure that, with a fair field and no favor,
it could make its own way; and each animated by a jealous fear that,
if any connection of State and Church were permitted, some rival
denomination would get an unfair advantage.
Already the spirit of our schooling is permeated with the feeling that
every subject, every topic, every fact, every professed truth must be
submitted to a certain publicity and impartiality.  All proffered
samples of learning must go to the same assay-room and be subjected to
common tests.  It is the essence of all dogmatic faiths to hold that
any such "show-down" is sacrilegious and perverse.  The characteristic
of religion, from their point of view, is that it is intellectually
secret, not public; peculiarly revealed, not generally known;
authoritatively declared, not communicated and tested in ordinary
ways...It is pertinent to point out that, as long as religion is
conceived as it is now by the great majority of professed religionists,
there is something self-contradictory in speaking of education in
religion in the same sense in which we speak of education in topics
where the method of free inquiry has made its way.  The "religious"
would be the last to be willing that either the history of the
content of religion should be taught in this spirit; while those
to whom the scientific standpoint is not merely a technical device,
but is the embodiment of the integrity of mind, must protest against
its being taught in any other spirit.
In the broad and final sense all institutions are educational in the
sense that they operate to form the attitudes, dispositions, abilities
and disabilities that constitute a concrete personality...Whether this
educative process is carried on in a predominantly democratic or non-
democratic way becomes, therefore, a question of transcendent importance
not only for education itself but for its final effect upon all the
interests and activities of a society that is committed to the democratic
way of life.

The Middle East is certainly the nexus of turmoil for a long time to come --
with shifting players, but the same game: upheaval.  I think we will be
confronting militant Islam -- particularly fallout from the Iranian
revolution -- and religion will once more, as it has in our own more
distant past -- play a role at least as standard-bearer in death and mayhem.
...One thing is that, unlike any other Western democracy that I know of,
this country has operated since its beginnings with a basic distrust of
government.  We are constituted not for efficient operation of government,
but for minimizing the possibility of abuse of power.  It took the events
of the Roosevelt era -- a catastrophic economic collapse and a world war --
to introduce the strong central government that we now know.  But in most
parts of the country today, the reluctance to have government is still
strong.  I think, barring a series of catastrophic events, that we can
look to at least another decade during which many of the big problems
around this country will have to be addressed by institutions other than
federal government.

While it cannot be proved retrospectively that any experience of possession,

we must ask how one differentiates "real transcendence" from neuropathies
that produce the same extreme realness, profundity, ineffability, and sense
of cosmic unity.  When accounts of sudden religious conversions in TLEs
[temporal-lobe epileptics] are laid alongside the epiphanous revelations of
the religious tradition, the parallels are striking.  The same is true of the
recent spate of alleged UFO abductees.  Parsimony alone argues against invoking

Two things are certain about science.  It does not stand still for long,
and it is never boring.  Oh, among some poor souls, including even
intellectuals in fields of high scholarship, science is frequently
misperceived.  Many see it as only a body of facts, promulgated from
on high in must, unintelligible textbooks, a collection of unchanging
precepts defended with authoritarian vigor.  Others view it as nothing
but a cold, dry narrow, plodding, rule-bound process -- the scientific
method: hidebound, linear, and left brained.
These people are the victims of their own stereotypes.  They are
destined to view the world of science with a set of blinders.  They
know nothing of the tumult, cacophony, rambunctiousness, and
tendentiousness of the actual scientific process, let alone the
creativity, passion, and joy of discovery.  And they are likely to
know little of the continual procession of new insights and discoveries
that every day, in some way, change our view (if not theirs) of the
natural world.

I did cancel one performance in Holland where they thought my music was so easy
that they didn't rehearse at all.  And so the first time when I found that out,
I rehearsed the orchestra myself in front of the audience of 3,000 people and
the next day I rehearsed through the second movement -- this was the piece
_Cheap Imitation_ -- and they then were ashamed.  The Dutch people were ashamed
and they invited me to come to the Holland festival and they promised to
rehearse.  And when I got to Amsterdam they had changed the orchestra, and
again, they hadn't rehearsed.  So they were no more prepared the second time
than they had been the first.  I gave them a lecture and told them to cancel
the performance; they then said over the radio that i had insisted on their
cancelling the performance because they were "insufficiently Zen."

Inadmissible:  Not competent to be considered.  Said of certain kinds of
testimony which juries are supposed to be unfit to be entrusted with,
and which judges, therefore, rule out, even of proceedings before themselves
alone.  Hearsay evidence is inadmissible because the person quoted was
unsworn and is not before the court for examination; yet most momentous
actions, military, political, commercial and of every other kind, are
daily undertaken on hearsay evidence.  There is no religion in the world
that has any other basis than hearsay evidence.  Revelation is hearsay
evidence; that the Scriptures are the word of God we have only the
testimony of men long dead whose identity is not clearly established and
who are not known to have been sworn in any sense.  Under the rules of
evidence as they now exist in this country, no single assertion in the
Bible has in its support any evidence admissible in a court of law...
But as records of courts of justice are admissible, it can easily be proved
that powerful and malevolent magicians once existed and were a scourge to
mankind.  The evidence (including confession) upon which certain women
were convicted of witchcraft and executed was without a flaw; it is still
unimpeachable.  The judges' decisions based on it were sound in logic and
in law.  Nothing in any existing court was ever more thoroughly proved than
the charges of witchcraft and sorcery for which so many suffered death.
If there were no witches, human testimony and human reason are alike
destitute of value.  --Ambrose Bierce

...the Soviets have the capability to try big projects.  If there is a goal,
such as when Gorbachev states that they are going to have nuclear-powered
aircraft carriers, the case is closed -- that is it.  They will concentrate
on the problem, do a bad job, and later pay the price.  They really don't
care what the price is.
There is something you must understand about the Soviet system.  They have the
ability to concentrate all their efforts on a given design, and develop all
components simultaneously, but sometimes without proper testing.  Then they end
up with a technological disaster like the Tu-144.  In a technology race at
the time, that aircraft was two months ahead of the Concorde.  Four Tu-144s
were built; two have crashed, and two are in museums.  The Concorde has been

"I have a friend who just got back from the Soviet Union, and told me the people
there are hungry for information about the West.  He was asked about many
things, but I will give you two examples that are very revealing about life in
the Soviet Union.  The first question he was asked was if we had exploding
television sets.  You see, they have a problem with the picture tubes on color
television sets, and many are exploding.  They assumed we must be having
problems with them too.  The other question he was asked often was why the
CIA had killed Samantha Smith, the little girl who visited the Soviet Union a
few years ago; their propaganda is very effective.
"...I could accept this openness, glasnost, perestroika, or whatever you want
to call it if they did these things: abolish the one party system; open the
Soviet frontier and allow Soviet people to travel freely; allow the Soviet
people to have real free enterprise; allow Western businessmen to do business
there, and permit freedom of speech and of the press.  But so far, the whole
country is like a concentration camp.  The barbed wire on the fence around
the Soviet Union is to keep people inside, in the dark.  This openness that
you are seeing, all these changes, are cosmetic and they have been designed
to impress shortsighted, naive, sometimes stupid Western leaders.  These
leaders gush over Gorbachev, hoping to do business with the Soviet Union or
appease it.  He will say: "Yes, we can do business!"  This while his
military machine in Afghanistan has killed over a million people out of a
population of 17 million.  Can you imagine that?
"Remember Kruschev:  he tried to do too many things too fast, and he was
removed in disgrace.  If Gorbachev tries to destroy the system or make too
many fundamental changes to it, I believe the system will get rid of him.
I am not a political scientist, but I understand the system very well.
I believe he will have a "heart attack" or retire or be removed.  He is
up against a brick wall.  If you think they will change everything and
become a free, open society, forget it!"

"If you want the best things to happen in corporate life you have to find ways
to be hospitable to the unusual person.  You don't get innovation as a
democratic process.  You almost get it as an anti-democratic process.
Certainly you get it as an anthitetical process, so you have to have an
environment where the body of people are really amenable to change and can
deal with the conflicts that arise out of change an innovation."
"In corporate life, I think there are three important areas which contracts
can't deal with, the area of conflict, the area of change and area of reaching
potential.  To me a covenant is a relationship that is based on such things
as shared ideals and shared value systems and shared ideas and shared
agreement as to the processes we are going to use for working together.  In
many cases they develop into real love relationships."
Another goal is to establish a relationship "in which it is OK for everybody
to do their best.  There are an awful lot of people in management who really
don't want subordinates to do their best, because it gets to be very
threatening.  But we have found that both internally and with outside
designers if we are willing to have this kind of relationship and if we're
willing to be vulnerable to what will come out of it, we get really good
work."
In his book, Mr. DePree tells the story of how designer George Nelson urged
that the company also take on Charles Eames in the late 1940s.  Max's father,
J. DePree, co-founder of the company with herman Miller in 1923, asked Mr.
Nelson if he really wanted to share the limited opportunities of a then-small
company with another designer.  "George's response was something like this:
'Charles Eames is an unusual talent.  He is very different from me.  The
company needs us both.  I want very much to have Charles Eames share in
whatever potential there is.'"
Mr. DePree believes participative capitalism is the wave of the future.  The
U.S. work force, he believes, "more and more demands to be included in the
capitalist system and if we don't find ways to get the capitalist system
to be an inclusive system rather than the exclusive system it has been, we're
all in deep trouble.  If we don't find ways to begin to understand that
capitalism's highest potential lies in the common good, not in the individual
good, then we're risking the system itself."
Mr. DePree also expects a "tremendous social change" in all workplaces.  "When
I first started working 40 years ago, a factory supervisor was focused on the
product.  Today it is drastically different, because of the social milieu.
It isn't unusual for a worker to arrive on his shift and have some family
problem that he doesn't know how to resolve.  The example I like to use is a
guy who comes in and says 'this isn't going to be a good day for me, my son
is in jail on a drunk-driving charge and I don't know how to raise bail.'
What that means is that if the supervisor wants productivity, he has to know
how to raise bail."

"The stars are made of the same atoms as the earth."  I usually pick one small
topic like this to give a lecture on.  Poets say science takes away from the
beauty of the stars -- mere gobs of gas atoms.  Nothing is "mere."  I too can
see the stars on a desert night, and feel them.  But do I see less or more?
The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination -- stuck on this carousel
my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light.  A vast pattern -- of which

is belching there.  Or see them with the greater eye of Palomar, rushing all
apart from some common starting point when they were perhaps all together.
What is the pattern, or the meaning, or the *why?*  It does not do harm to the
mystery to know a little about it.  For far more marvelous is the truth than
any artists of the past imagined!  Why do the poets of the present not speak
of it?  What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were like a man, but
if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?
If you permit yourself to read meanings into (rather than drawing meanings out

"Pseudocode can be used to some extent to aid the maintenance
process.  However, pseudocode that is highly detailed -
approaching the level of detail of the code itself - is not of
much use as maintenance documentation.  Such detailed
documentation has to be maintained almost as much as the code,
thus doubling the maintenance burden.  Furthermore, since such
voluminous pseudocode is too distracting to be kept in the
listing itself, it must be kept in a separate folder.  The
result: Since pseudocode - unlike real code - doesn't have to be
maintained, no one will maintain it.  It will soon become out of
date and everyone will ignore it.  (Once, I did an informal
survey of 42 shops that used pseudocode.  Of those 42, 0 [zero!],
found that it had any value as maintenance documentation."

The magician is seated in his high chair and looks upon the world with favor.
He is at the height of his powers.  If he closes his eyes, he causes the world
to disappear.  If he opens his eyes, he causes the world to come back.  If
there is harmony within him, the world is harmonious.  If rage shatters his
inner harmony, the unity of the world is shattered.  If desire arises within
him, he utters the magic syllables that causes the desired object to appear.
His wishes, his thoughts, his gestures, his noises command the universe.
An Animal that knows who it is, one that has a sense of his own identity, is
a discontented creature, doomed to create new problems for himself for the
duration of his stay on this planet.  Since neither the mouse nor the chimp
knows what is, he is spared all the vexing problems that follow this
discovery.  But as soon as the human animal who asked himself this question
emerged, he plunged himself and his descendants into an eternity of doubt
and brooding, speculation and truth-seeking that has goaded him through the
centuries as relentlessly as hunger or sexual longing.  The chimp that does
not know that he exists is not driven to discover his origins and is spared
the tragic necessity of contemplating his own end.  And even if the animal
experimenters succeed in teaching a chimp to count one hundred bananas or
to play chess, the chimp will develop no science and he will exhibit no
appreciation of beauty, for the greatest part of man's wisdom may be traced
back to the eternal questions of beginnings and endings, the quest to give
meaning to his existence, to life itself.

First as to speech.  That privilege rests upon the premise that
there is no proposition so uniformly acknowledged that it may not be
lawfully challenged, questioned, and debated.  It need not rest upon
the further premise that there are no propositions that are not
open to doubt; it is enough, even if there are, that in the end it is
worse to suppress dissent than to run the risk of heresy.  Hence it
has been again and again unconditionally proclaimed that there are
no limits to the privilege so far as words seek to affect only the hearers'
beliefs and not their conduct.  The trouble is that conduct is almost
always based upon some belief, and that to change the hearer's belief
will generally to some extent change his conduct, and may even evoke
conduct that the law forbids.

Refreshed by a brief blackout, I got to my feet and went next door.
The sprung doors parted and I staggered out into the lobby's teak and flicker.
Uniformed men stood by impassively like sentries in their trench.  I slapped
my key on the desk and nodded gravely.  I was loaded enough to be unable to

New York is a jungle, they tell you.  You could go further, and say that

The reported resort to astrology in the White House has occasioned much
merriment.  It is not funny.  Astrological gibberish, which means astrology
generally, has no place in a newspaper, let alone government.  Unlike comics,
which are part of a newspaper's harmless pleasure and make no truth claims,
astrology is a fraud.  The idea that it gets a hearing in government is
dismaying.
Astrology is the sheerest hokum.  This pseudoscience has been around since
the day of the Chaldeans and Babylonians.  It is as phony as numerology,
phrenology, palmistry, alchemy, the reading of tea leaves, and the practice
of divination by the entrails of a goat.  No serious person will buy the
notion that our lives are influenced individually by the movement of
distant planets.  This is the sawdust blarney of the carnival midway.
A serious public debate about the validity of astrology?  A serious believer
in the White House?  Two of them?  Give me a break.  What stifled my laughter
is that the image fits.  Reagan has always exhibited a fey indifference toward
science.  Facts, like numbers, roll off his back.  And we've all come to
accept it.  This time it was stargazing that became a serious issue....Not
that long ago, it was Reagan's support of Creationism....Creationists actually
got equal time with evolutionists.  The public was supposed to be open-minded
to the claims of paleontologists and fundamentalists, as if the two were
scientific colleagues....It has been clear for a long time that the president
is averse to science...In general, these attitudes fall onto friendly American
turf....But at the outer edges, this skepticism about science easily turns
into a kind of naive acceptance of nonscience, or even nonsense.  The same
people who doubt experts can also believe any quackery, from the benefits of
laetrile to eye of newt to the movement of planets.  We lose the capacity to
make rational -- scientific -- judgments.  It's all the same.
The spectacle of astrology in the White House -- the governing center of
the world's greatest scientific and military power -- is so appalling that
it defies understanding and provides grounds for great fright.  The easiest
response is to laugh it off, and to indulge in wisecracks about Civil
Service ratings for horoscope makers and palm readers and whether Reagan
asked Mikhail Gorbachev for his sign.  A contagious good cheer is the
hallmark of this presidency, even when the most dismal matters are concerned.
But this time, it isn't funny.  It's plain scary.
[Astrology is] 100 percent hokum, Ted.  As a matter of fact, the first edition
of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, written in 1771 -- 1771! -- said that this
belief system is a subject long ago ridiculed and reviled.  We're dealing with
beliefs that go back to the ancient Babylonians.  There's nothing there....
It sounds a lot like science, it sounds like astronomy.  It's got technical
terms.  It's got jargon.  It confuses the public....The astrologer is quite
glib, confuses the public, uses terms which come from science, come from
metaphysics, come from a host of fields, but they really mean nothing.  The
fact is that astrological beliefs go back at least 2,500 years.  Now that
should be a sufficiently long time for astrologers to prove their case.  They
have not proved their case....It's just simply gibberish.  The fact is, there's
no theory for it, there are no observational data for it.  It's been tested
and tested over the centuries.  Nobody's ever found any validity to it at
all.  It is not even close to a science.  A science has to be repeatable, it
has to have a logical foundation, and it has to be potentially vulnerable --
you test it.  And in that astrology is really quite something else.
Even if we put all these nagging thoughts [four embarrassing questions about
astrology] aside for a moment, one overriding question remains to be asked.
Why would the positions of celestial objects at the moment of birth have an
effect on our characters, lives, or destinies?  What force or influence,
what sort of energy would travel from the planets and stars to all human
beings and affect our development or fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding
jargon or computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise this central
problem with astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which
celestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .
Some astrologers argue that there may be a still unknown force that represents
the astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like those
of any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always
claim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of their
efficacy, so in the last two decades scientists and statisticians have
generously done such testing for them.  There have been dozens of well-designed
tests all around the world, and astrology has failed every one of them. . . .
I propose that we let those beckoning lights in the sky awaken our interest
in the real (and fascinating) universe beyond our planet, and not let them
keep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by
the firelight, afraid of the night.
With the news that Nancy Reagan has referred to an astrologer when planning
her husband's schedule, and reports of Californians evacuating Los Angeles
on the strength of a prediction from a sixteenth-century physician and
astrologer Michel de Notredame, the image of the U.S. as a scientific and
technological nation has taking a bit of a battering lately.  Sadly, such
happenings cannot be dismissed as passing fancies.  They are manifestations
of a well-established "anti-science" tendency in the U.S. which, ultimately,
could threaten the country's position as a technological power. . . .  The
manifest widespread desire to reject rationality and substitute a series
of quasirandom beliefs in order to understand the universe does not augur
well for a nation deeply concerned about its ability to compete with its
industrial equals.  To the degree that it reflects the thinking of a
significant section of the public, this point of view encourages ignorance
of and, indeed, contempt for science and for rational methods of approaching
truth. . . . It is becoming clear that if the U.S. does not pick itself up
soon and devote some effort to educating the young effectively, its hope of
maintaining a semblance of leadership in the world may rest, paradoxically,
with a new wave of technically interested and trained immigrants who do not
suffer from the anti-science disease rampant in an apparently decaying society.

As for the basic assumptions about individuality and self, this is the core

Q: Somebody just posted that Roman Polanski directed Star Wars.  What
should I do?
A: Post the correct answer at once!  We can't have people go on believing
that!  Very good of you to spot this.  You'll probably be the only one to
make the correction, so post as soon as you can.  No time to lose, so
certainly don't wait a day, or check to see if somebody else has made the
correction.
And it's not good enough to send the message by mail.  Since you're the
only one who really knows that it was Francis Coppola, you have to inform
the whole net right away!
Q: How can I choose what groups to post in?  ...
Q: How about an example?
A: Ok.  Let's say you want to report that Gretzky has been traded from the
Oilers to the Kings.  Now right away you might think rec.sport.hockey
would be enough.  WRONG.  Many more people might be interested.  This is a
big trade!  Since it's a NEWS article, it belongs in the news.* hierarchy
as well.  If you are a news admin, or there is one on your machine, try
news.admin.  If not, use news.misc.
The Oilers are probably interested in geology, so try sci.physics.  He is
a big star, so post to sci.astro, and sci.space because they are also
interested in stars.  Next, his name is Polish sounding.  So post to
soc.culture.polish.  But that group doesn't exist, so cross-post to
news.groups suggesting it should be created.  With this many groups of
interest, your article will be quite bizarre, so post to talk.bizarre as
well.  (And post to comp.std.mumps, since they hardly get any articles
there, and a "comp" group will propagate your article further.)
You may also find it is more fun to post the article once in each group.
If you list all the newsgroups in the same article, some newsreaders will
only show the article to the reader once!  Don't tolerate this.
Q: I cant spell worth a dam.  I hope your going too tell me what to do?
A: Don't worry about how your articles look.  Remember it's the message
that counts, not the way it's presented.  Ignore the fact that sloppy
spelling in a purely written forum sends out the same silent messages that
soiled clothing would when addressing an audience.
Q: They just announced on the radio that Dan Quayle was picked as the
Republican V.P. candidate.  Should I post?
A: Of course.  The net can reach people in as few as 3 to 5 days.  It's
the perfect way to inform people about such news events long after the
broadcast networks have covered them.  As you are probably the only person
to have heard the news on the radio, be sure to post as soon as you can.

I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradictions to the sentiments of
others, and all positive assertion of my own.  I even forbade myself the use
of every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion,
such as "certainly", "undoubtedly", etc.   I adopted instead of them "I
conceive", "I apprehend", or "I imagine" a thing to be so or so; or "so it
appears to me at present".
When another asserted something that I thought an error, I denied myself the
pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing him immediately some
absurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began by observing that in
certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present
case there appeared or seemed to me some difference, etc.
I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I
engaged in went on more pleasantly.  The modest way in which I proposed my
opinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction.  I had
less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily
prevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I
happened to be in the right.

One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship with
Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just
to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn't
be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending
to be so outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn't
understand what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid.  He was
renowned for being quite clever and quite clearly was so -- but not all the
time, which obviously worried him, hence the act.  He preferred people to be
puzzled rather than contemptuous.  This above all appeared to Trillian to be
genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about.
Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of the
former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and largely tax free.
Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking adventure and
reward among the furthest reaches of Galactic space.  In those days, spirits
were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women
and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures
from Alpha Centauri.  And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty
deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before -- and thus
was the Empire forged.

Even the most irrational people usually think they are logical thinkers.
Every man who has reached even his intellectual teens begins to suspect
that life is no farce; that it is not genteel comedy even; that it flowers
and fructifies on the contrary out of the profoundest tragic depths of the

He has shown you, o man, what is good.  And what does the Lord ask of you,

He knows not how to know who knows not also how to unknow.
He that composes himself is wiser than he that composes a book.
He thought of Musashi, the Sword Saint, standing in his garden more than
three hundred years ago. "What is the 'Body of a rock'?" he was asked.
In answer, Musashi summoned a pupil of his and bid him kill himself by

the Master stayed his hand, saying, "That is the 'Body of a rock'."
He who despairs over an event is a coward, but he who holds hopes for

Here is a test to find whether your mission on earth is finished:

I am not afraid of tomorrow, for I have seen yesterday and I love today.

If a man has a strong faith he can indulge in the luxury of skepticism.
If a man loses his reverence for any part of life, he will lose his

If I had a formula for bypassing trouble, I would not pass it around.
Trouble creates a capacity to handle it.  I don't say embrace trouble; that's
as bad as treating it as an enemy.  But I do say meet it as a friend, for
you'll see a lot of it and you had better be on speaking terms with it.
If I had my life to live over, I'd try to make more mistakes next time.  I
would relax, I would limber up, I would be sillier than I have been this
trip.  I know of very few things I would take seriously.  I would be crazier.
I would climb more mountains, swim more rivers and watch more sunsets.  I'd
travel and see.  I would have more actual troubles and fewer imaginary ones.
You see, I am one of those people who lives prophylactically and sensibly
and sanely, hour after hour, day after day.  Oh, I have had my moments and,
if I had it to do over again, I'd have more of them.  In fact, I'd try to
have nothing else.  Just moments, one after another, instead of living so many
years ahead each day.  I have been one of those people who never go anywhere
without a thermometer, a hotwater bottle, a gargle, a raincoat and a parachute.
If I had it to do over again, I would go places and do things and travel
lighter than I have.  If I had my life to live over, I would start bare-footed
earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall.  I would play hooky
more.  I probably wouldn't make such good grades, but I'd learn more.  I would
ride on more merry-go-rounds.  I'd pick more daisies.
If little green men land in your back yard, hide any little green women

If something has not yet gone wrong then it would ultimately have been

If we don't survive, we don't do anything else.
If you are not for yourself, who will be for you?
If you are for yourself, then what are you?

If you find a solution and become attached to it, the solution may become
your next problem.

In dwelling, be close to the land.
In meditation, delve deep into the heart.
In dealing with others, be gentle and kind.
In speech, be true.
In work, be competent.
In action, be careful of your timing.
In order to discover who you are, first learn who everybody else is;

In order to live free and happily, you must sacrifice boredom.
It is not always an easy sacrifice.

In the long run we are all dead.
In the next world, you're on your own.
Indeed, the first noble truth of Buddhism, usually translated as

with a sense of pervasive unsatisfactoriness.'
Instead of loving your enemies, treat your friends a little better.

So far as a man thinks, he is free.
It does not do to leave a live dragon out of your calculations.
It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle if it is

It is Fortune, not Wisdom, that rules man's life.
It is not doing the thing we like to do, but liking the thing we have to do,
that makes life blessed.
It is only by risking our persons from one hour to another that we live
at all.  And often enough our faith beforehand in an uncertified result
is the only thing that makes the result come true.
It is only with the heart one can see clearly; what is essential is
invisible to the eye.
It is said that the lonely eagle flies to the mountain peaks while the lowly

It is so stupid of modern civilisation to have given up believing in the

It is through symbols that man consciously or unconsciously lives, works

It's easier to take it apart than to put it back together.
It's hard to drive at the limit, but it's harder to know where the limits are.

Mohandas K. Gandhi often changed his mind publicly.  An aide once asked him

Nasrudin called at a large house to collect for charity.  The servant said
"My master is out."  Nasrudin replied, "Tell your master that next time he
goes out, he should not leave his face at the window.  Someone might steal it."
Nasrudin returned to his village from the imperial capital, and the villagers
gathered around to hear what had passed.  "At this time," said Nasrudin, "I
only want to say that the King spoke to me."  All the villagers but the
stupidest ran off to spread the wonderful news.  The remaining villager
asked, "What did the King say to you?"  "What he said -- and quite distinctly,
for everyone to hear -- was 'Get out of my way!'" The simpleton was overjoyed;
he had heard words actually spoken by the King, and seen the very man they
were spoken to.
Nasrudin walked into a shop one day, and the owner came forward to serve
him.  Nasrudin said, "First things first.  Did you see me walk into your
shop?"
Nasrudin walked into a teahouse and declaimed, "The moon is more useful
than the sun."
Nasrudin was carrying home a piece of liver and the recipe for liver pie.
Suddenly a bird of prey swooped down and snatched the piece of meat from his
hand.  As the bird flew off, Nasrudin called after it, "Foolish bird!  You
have the liver, but what can you do with it without the recipe?"
Ninety percent of everything is crap.
Ninety percent of the time things turn out worse than you thought they would.

One day the King decided that he would force all his subjects to tell the
truth.  A gallows was erected in front of the city gates.  A herald announced,
"Whoever would enter the city must first answer the truth to a question
which will be put to him."  Nasrudin was first in line.  The captain of the
guard asked him, "Where are you going?  Tell the truth -- the alternative
is death by hanging."

Perhaps the biggest disappointments were the ones you expected anyway.
Philosophy will clip an angel's wings.
Push where it gives and scratch where it itches.
Reality always seems harsher in the early morning.
Reality does not exist -- yet.
Reality is bad enough, why should I tell the truth?
Reality is for people who lack imagination.
Reality is just a convenient measure of complexity.
Reality is just a crutch for people who can't handle science fiction.
Reality is nothing but a collective hunch.

Rule of Life #1 -- Never get separated from your luggage.
Seeing is believing.  You wouldn't have seen it if you hadn't believed it.
Since everything in life is but an experience perfect in being what it is,
having nothing to do with good or bad, acceptance or rejection, one may well
burst out in laughter.
So little time, so little to do.
Sometimes you get an almost irresistible urge to go on living.
Standards are different for all things, so the standard set by man is by
no means the only 'certain' standard.  If you mistake what is relative for
something certain, you have strayed far from the ultimate truth.
Suffering alone exists, none who suffer;
The deed there is, but no doer thereof;
Nirvana is, but no one is seeking it;
The Path there is, but none who travel it.
Superstition, idolatry, and hypocrisy have ample wages, but truth goes

Take your dying with some seriousness, however.  Laughing on the way to

The eye is a menace to clear sight, the ear is a menace to subtle hearing,

of the Northern Ocean, happened once to meet in the realm of Chaos, the god
of the center.  Chaos treated them very handsomely and they discussed together
what they could do to repay his kindness.  They had noticed that, whereas
everyone else had seven apertures, for sight, hearing, eating, breathing and
so on, Chaos had none.  So they decided to make the experiment of boring holes
in him.  Every day they bored a hole, and on the seventh day, Chaos died.

The most costly of all follies is to believe passionately in the palpably

The only difference between a rut and a grave is their dimensions.
The only happiness lies in reason; all the rest of the world is dismal.
The highest reason, however, I see in the work of the artist, and he may
experience it as such.  Happiness lies in the swiftness of feeling and
thinking: all the rest of the world is slow, gradual and stupid.  Whoever
could feel the course of a light ray would be very happy, for it is very
swift.  Thinking of oneself gives little happiness.  If, however, one feels
much happiness in this, it is because at bottom one is not thinking of
oneself but of one's ideal.  This is far, and only the swift shall reach
it and are delighted.
The optimist thinks that this is the best of all possible worlds,
and the pessimist knows it.
Yet creeds mean very little, Coth answered the dark god, still speaking

possible worlds; and the pessimist fears this is true.

The savior becomes the victim.
The state of innocence contains the germs of all future sin.
The true way goes over a rope which is not stretched at any great height

The truth is rarely pure, and never simple.
The truth is what is; what should be is a dirty lie.
The truth of a thing is the feel of it, not the think of it.
The truth you speak has no past and no future.  It is, and that's all it

The world is your exercise-book, the pages on which you do your sums.
It is not reality, although you can express reality there if you wish.
You are also free to write nonsense, or lies, or to tear the pages.
There are no accidents whatsoever in the universe.
There are no winners in life, only survivors.
There are ten or twenty basic truths, and life is the process of
discovering them over and over and over.
There is more to life than increasing its speed.
There is no comfort without pain; thus we define salvation through suffering.
There is no cure for birth and death other than to enjoy the interval.
There is no sin but ignorance.

Two men came before Nasrudin when he was magistrate.  The first man said,
"This man has bitten my ear -- I demand compensation." The second man said,
"He bit it himself." Nasrudin withdrew to his chambers, and spent an hour
trying to bite his own ear.  He succeeded only in falling over and bruising
his forehead.  Returning to the courtroom, Nasrudin pronounced, "Examine the
man whose ear was bitten. If his forehead is bruised, he did it himself and
the case is dismissed.  If his forehead is not bruised, the other man did it
and must pay three silver pieces."
Two men were sitting over coffee, contemplating the nature of things,

Waste not fresh tears over old griefs.
We can embody the truth, but we cannot know it.
We have no choice but to live our lives as if we had free will.
We have nowhere else to go... this is all we have.
We have only two things to worry about:  That things will never get
back to normal, and that they already have.
We have reason to be afraid.  This is a terrible place.
We rarely find anyone who can say he has lived a happy life, and who,
content with his life, can retire from the world like a satisfied guest.
We're all in this alone.
We're mortal -- which is to say, we're ignorant, stupid, and sinful --

"We're not talking about the same thing," he said. "For you the world is
weird because if you're not bored with it you're at odds with it. For me
the world is weird because it is stupendous, awesome, mysterious,
unfathomable; my interest has been to convince you that you must accept
responsibility for being here, in this marvelous world, in this marvelous
desert, in this marvelous time.  I wanted to convince you that you must
learn to make every act count, since you are going to be here for only a
short while, in fact, too short for witnessing all the marvels of it."

able to rummage at will among the bits and pieces of data he had absorbed,

All things, those previously trivial as well as those once thought important,
became absolutely equal by acquiring an absolute value, revealing relationships
not evident to ordinary vision.  Like beads strung on a string of their own
meaning, each thing pointed to its own common ground of existence, shared by
all.  Finally, each began to melt into each, staying itself while becoming
all others.  And Mind no longer contemplated Problem, but became Problem,
destroying Subject-Object by becoming them.

When the wind is great, bow before it;
when the wind is heavy, yield to it.
When you are young, you enjoy a sustained illusion that sooner or later
something marvelous is going to happen, that you are going to transcend
your parents' limitations...  At the same time, you feel sure that in all
the wilderness of possibility; in all the forests of opinion, there is a
vital something that can be known -- known and grasped.  That we will
eventually know it, and convert the whole mystery into a coherent
narrative.  So that then one's true life -- the point of everything --
will emerge from the mist into a pure light, into total comprehension.
But it isn't like that at all.  But if it isn't, where did the idea come
from, to torture and unsettle us?
When you die, you lose a very important part of your life.

Wisdom is knowing what to do with what you know.
Wisdom is rarely found on the best-seller list.

You are never given a wish without also being given the

You can always pick up your needle and move to another groove.
You can get *anywhere* in ten minutes if you drive fast enough.
You can never tell which way the train went by looking at the tracks.
You can no more win a war than you can win an earthquake.
You can only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.

You can't take it with you -- especially when crossing a state line.
You climb to reach the summit, but once there, discover that all roads

You will always find something in the last place you look.
"You would do well not to imagine profundity," he said.  "Anything that seems
of momentous occasion should be dwelt upon as though it were of slight note.
Conversely, trivialities must be attended to with the greatest of care.
Because death is momentous, give it no thought; because victory is important,
give it no thought; because the method of achievement and discovery is less
momentous than the effect, dwell always upon the method.  You will strengthen
yourself in this way."
Your happiness is intertwined with your outlook on life.
Your only obligation in any lifetime is to be true to yourself.  Being
true to anyone else or anything else is not only impossible, but the

Where were you born?  Where is your home?  Where are you going?  What

There is a secret person undamaged within every individual.
We are governed not by armies and police but by ideas.
